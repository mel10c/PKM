I hope this site can inspire others to craft their creative corners as well.\n\nConcerning the languages used in the articles, due to my experience as an international student since the sixth grade, I tend to utilize the two languages (English and Mandarin) differently to help me organize my thoughts. Thus, the articles on this site will also be organized according to their relevant cultural contexts or by which I acquired the concepts. With that being said, please don't feel excluded by the different languages on this website, hope everybody can enjoy their time here!\n\n---\n\n嘿！我是 Melaney， 一名多大认知科学的学生。欢迎来到我在网络上的小小思维世界，在这里我会尽力分享我学到的东西，有趣的想法、我的摄影作品、以及其他我想展示给世界的东西！\n\n尽管这是我的个人博客网站，但我是非常希望能助力互联网成为一个更包容的平台，即使只是在这一个小小角落。我希望我的博客可以激励其他人一起参与创作，打造属于我们的思维世界。\n\n关于网站内文章使用的不同语言，因我自从六年级以来，一直在加拿大留学，所以我相对习惯于在两种语言中穿插讲述。我相信语言只是一个传递思想的媒介，因此网站内的文章都会根据它们语言的相关文化背景以及不同的知识获取渠道来分类撰写。请不要因为不同的语言分化而感到不适，我本意无任何区别对待的意思，希望大家能看得开心！\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-05-10T19:08:03.578968457Z","tags":[]},"/UofT-Notes/ANT100/ANT100-Lecture_1":{"title":"ANT100: Lecture_1","content":"\n#  Lecture 1\n\n### Course overview\n- Privilege is what's **not been asked**\n    - White will not been asks where are they from\n- In the earlier days, most specialist are white men, but most of the groups they studied are people of colour\n    - Therefore, according to this tradition, it created a belief there are great differences between different cultures\n    - Physical, archaeology, linguist, social-cultural all developed in order as information was passed back from the studies around the world\n    - Contemporary anthropology have developed out of the white-male dominated group, and more emphasized were placed on the unique cultures among everyone\n\n\n#### How the course works\n- Pre-class work (readings)\n    - Most available on Quercus site\n    - *Lehman (Evo) and Gosden 2018* from UofT bookstore\n- Weekly synchronous (live) lecture with a limited Q\u0026A\n- All lectures will be recorded and released Friday at 12 noon\n    - The post-class quiz (worth 4% of the mark), it will be due on the following Monday at noon\n\n\n- Tutorials\n    - Begin Sept. 21 (week 1), every another week a tutorial will take place\n    - Will be held on BB collaborate\n    - Attendance and participation worth 10% of the final mark\n","lastmodified":"2023-05-10T19:08:03.558968267Z","tags":["Note"]},"/UofT-Notes/ANT100/ANT100-Lecture_12":{"title":"ANT100: Lecture_12","content":"\n# **Inequality** \u0026 Post-colony\n\n## The postcolony\n\n- ==**\u003cu\u003ePostcolony\u003c/u\u003e**==\n\n  1.

Religious notion of separate creation for humans and animals \n\u003e \n\u003e - According to Bishop Usher, Earth was created on October 23, 4004 BC (2:30 pm)\n\u003e - Fixity of species: All species are unchanging and distinct, as created by God\n\u003e - Many ideas and concepts based on verbal accounts of travellers, which were often inaccurate\n\u003e - Belief that humans are divine, and above non-human animals\n\n### Development of Evolution Theory\n\n- **==Carolus Linneaus==** (1707-1778): Father of Taxonomy; **grouped species by genus**, based on physical resemblances; believed he was classifying God’s creations; *Scala Naturae*, leading up to humans on top; others continued his work after his death\n  - *Binomial Nomenclature* (system): First letter of genus capitalized, species designation lowercase [ex. *Homo sapiens*]\n- **Georges-Louis Leclerc** (1707-1788): Believed Earth was 75 000 years old; wrote book about it which was criticized by the church; founded biogeography (**different regions with similar climates have distinct plants and animals**)\n- **Jean-Baptiste Lamarck** (1744-1829)\n    - **Inheritance of Acquired Characteristics**: creatures have “vital traits” that help them adapt to environments, which are passed on to future generations; this theory does not support idea that giraffes willed their necks to grow longer\n- **==Charles Darwin==** (1809-1882): \n    - First concluded that Earth must have an ancient history, no fixity of species (kept ideas private)\n  - **Variation** leads to **advantages** for certain individuals, meaning **higher reproduction**, and said variation becomes the norm\n- **Thomas Malthus** (1766-1834): *Essay on the Principle of Population* (1798): more organisms are born than can possibly survive; individuals **adapt** to environments, which leads to evolutionary shift over time (Darwin)\n\n## Darwin’s Theory on Natural Selection:\n\n\u003e **All species (extant and extinct) share a common ancestor; species evolve by natural selection**\n\n- **==Alfred Russell Wallace==** (1823-1913): Writes to Darwin, describing ideals similar to those Darwin has kept hidden for years, less evidence but similar core ideas; joint presentation of ideas proposed\n- Darwin published *On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection or The Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life*\n- The word “evolution” does **NOT** appear in the first edition of *Origins of Species*Darwin avoided implications of general progress or directionality; his later works apply evolution to humans\n\n### Natural Selection\n\n- A **process in nature resulting in survival** and perpetuation of only those forms of life having certain **favourable ==characteristics==** that enable them to **==adapt== best to their environment.**\n\n#### Three postulates of Darwinian Evolution:\n\n1. **Struggle for existence**: ability of population to expand is infinite, but their environment is finite\n2. **Variation in fitness**: Organisms vary, some individuals possess traits enabling them to survive and reproduce more successfully than others in the same environment\n3. **Inheritance of variation**: Advantageous traits inherited by offspring become more common in succeeding generations. Traits that confer advantages in survival and reproduction retained in population; *disadvantageous traits disappear*.\n\n### **Sexual selection**\n\n- Certain evolutionary traits can be explained by ==**intraspecific**== (within-species) ==**competition**== \n  - [Male birds are much more brightly coloured than females, to better attract a mate)\n- Elaborate animal mating rituals, competition among males for female access\n- ***Evolution does not always result in general increase of fitness***\n  - Environment constantly changing (usually for the worse); Red Queen analogy (must keep running to survive); design limitations in biology\n\n### “Survival of the Fittest”: \n\n- Coined by **Herbert Spencer,** NOT Darwin\n- Proclaimed **wrongly** that *human struggles for existence leads to beneficiary evolution*; argued against policies that might interfere with this progress, like charity\n- Major weakness of Darwinian Evolution: **No explanation on how characteristics inherited;** Darwin could never prove it\n\n## Inheritance\n\n- **==Gregor Mendel==** (1822-1884): Pea plant experiment; chose pea plants for several reasons: \n  - \u003cu\u003eInbred\u003c/u\u003e: true-breeding lines\n  - \u003cu\u003eHybrids\u003c/u\u003e: quantify traits\n  - \u003cu\u003eObservable traits\u003c/u\u003e: flower colour, seed colour, etc.\n  - Plants small: easy to grow in large numbers, short generation time for several crosses per growing season\n  - Self-fertilizing: but can cross fertilize\n- Mendel cross-pollinated green and yellow plants (all yellow seeds produced), then self-pollinated yellow plants, and found 3:1 ratio of yellow to green seeds (green seeds are dormant trait)\\\n- Concluded each plant carries 2 copies of “factor” which determines a trait; published findings gathered little interest for over 100 years\n- No understanding of genetics at the time, Mendel could not explain his findings\n\n\u003e - Mendelian Traits in Humans: cleft chin (dominant), cheek dimples (dominant), free (dominant) or attached (recessive) earlobes, wet (dominant) or dry (recessive) earwax\n\u003e - Non-Mendelian Traits: eye colour, hair colour, Morton’s Toe, tongue rolling, wisdom, athletic ability\n","lastmodified":"2023-05-10T19:08:03.558968267Z","tags":["Note"]},"/UofT-Notes/ANT100/ANT100-Lecture_16":{"title":"ANT100: Lecture_16","content":"\n# Principles of Evolution\n\n`January 28`\n\n## Genetics Terms\n\n- \u003cu\u003eSomatic cells\u003c/u\u003e - most cells in body, except sex cells\n- \u003cu\u003eGametes\u003c/u\u003e - sex cells\n- \u003cu\u003eCytoplasm\u003c/u\u003e - mix of membranes, molecules, and organelles\n- \u003cu\u003eNucleus\u003c/u\u003e - contains hereditary material, or chromosomes\n- **\u003cu\u003eChromosomes\u003c/u\u003e** - Structures in nucleus containing genes that transmit traits through generations \n  - *(humans have 23 pairs, other animals have more)*\n\n### Critical Acids (DNA \u0026 RNA) Structure\n\n- \u003cu\u003eDeoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA)\u003c/u\u003e -  nucleic acid used to **store genetic information**\n  - Four bases: Adenine (A), Guanine (G), Cytosine (C), and Thymine (T) \n  - T bonds with A, G bonds with C\n- \u003cu\u003eRibonucleic Acid Molecules (RNA)\u003c/u\u003e\n  1.

Choose taxa whose evolutionary relationships interest you. These taxa must be \u003cu\u003eclades\u003c/u\u003e (monophyletic group) if you hope to come up with plausible results\n  2. Determine \u003cu\u003echaracters\u003c/u\u003e (features of organisms) and examine each taxon to determine character \u003cu\u003estates\u003c/u\u003e (decide whether each taxon does or does not have each character)\n  3. Determine polarity of characters (character state is original or derived in each taxon) using \u003cu\u003eout-group\u003c/u\u003e (more distantly related group of organisms that serves as a reference group)\n  4. Group taxa by \u003cu\u003esynapomorphies\u003c/u\u003e (shared derived characteristics; **derived**) not \u003cu\u003esymplesiomorphies\u003c/u\u003e (original, or “primitive”, characteristics; **ancestral**)\n\n- ##### 3 Misconceptions About Cladograms\n\n  1. Evolution produces patterns of relationships among organisms that are like a tree\n  2. Although cladograms are often organized from top to bottom, **don’t assume the taxa on top are more advanced than those taxa on the bottom**\n  3. Avoid reading across terminal nodes (tips), order of which has no meaning","lastmodified":"2023-05-10T19:08:03.558968267Z","tags":["Note"]},"/UofT-Notes/ANT100/ANT100-Lecture_17":{"title":"ANT100: Lecture_17","content":"\n# Primates\n\n`February 4`\n\n- ##### ==Key features of primates==\n\n  - **Grasping hands and feet**\n  - **Collarbone** (clavicle)\n  - Radius and **ulna**\n    \u003cimg src=\"https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/008eGmZEly1gpm3uwdx2fj309w0dbweu.jpg\" alt=\"inage\" style=\"zoom: 40%;\" /\u003e\n  - **Forward facing eyes** and stereoscopic vision\n  - **Body size**: double the size -\u003e 8x heavier\n    - Smaller animals have greater heat loss than larger animals\n\n- ##### Primate Activity Patterns\n\n  - \u003cu\u003eNocturnal\u003c/u\u003e: active at night\n  - \u003cu\u003eDiurnal\u003c/u\u003e: active during the day\n  - \u003cu\u003eCrepuscular\u003c/u\u003e: active at dawn and dusk\n  - \u003cu\u003eCathemeral\u003c/u\u003e: active any time of day or night\n\n- ##### Primate Diet\n\n  - Variety of **fruits**, **insects**, **flowers**, and **leaves** [eat only leaves require special gut adaptations]\n  - **Larger primates typically eat more leaves** while smaller primates eat more insects\n\n- ##### Primate Habitats\n\n  - Tropical **rainforests**, dry forests, deserts, and savannas; primary vs. secondary forests; ecological Niche; forest microhabitats: emergent layer, canopy, understory\n\n- ##### Primate Evolutionary Ecology\n\n  - *Bottom-up processes* - plants altering their form to help/deter a primate\n  - *Top-down processes* - pushed by predators\n  - *Other processes*- seed dispersal and pollination; predation pressures on primates; plant defensive adaptations: physical/chemical (like caffeine or giant hogweed, opium in poppies, cocaine in the coca plant)\n\n- ##### Primate Ranging Patterns\n\n  - \u003cu\u003eDaily path length\u003c/u\u003e - distance travelled in a day\n  - \u003cu\u003eDaily range\u003c/u\u003e - area the animal ventured into during a day\n  - \u003cu\u003eHome range\u003c/u\u003e - all the day ranges over the year; core area; territory\n\n- ##### Primate Conservation:\n\n  - Habitat disturbance: logging, agriculture; forest fragmentation\n  - Hunting pressures [**subsistence** (sustainable) vs **economic** (unsustainable)]\n\n  \u003e Ex.

Buried stone features lead to poorer crop growth directly above the stone\n\n\u003e ##### Ex1: Roman Harbour town of Altinum\n\u003e\n\u003e View full extent of or see how features are related; wider view of landscape; historical aerial photographs let you see landscape prior to recent development (example: 1930s photo of Poverty Point, Louisiana; 3600 – 3200 years old)\n\u003e\n\u003e ##### EX2: Amazon\n\u003e\n\u003e Recent research triggered by aerial photography (and deforestation); shows densely populated settlements, earthworks, and terraforming (about 1000 years old); evidence for farming \u0026 orchards\n\n#### \u003cu\u003eLIDAR:\u003c/u\u003e **Light Detection and Ranging**\n\n- Great in **heavily forested environments**, plane flies over area, sends laser signals, which then bounce back to the plane if they hit something, and then recorded\n\n- Records everything from top of the trees to the forest floor, remove forest signals to get map of ground level\n\n  \u003e Ex: Caracol (Mayan city-state) (quite remote site, discovered by a logger seeking mahogany); AD 550 to 900; over 4 billion measurements in 4 days; showed full extent of city and city viewed in 3D\n\n#### Satellite Images\n\n- Satellite images pick up on distinctive soil signatures\n\n- Formed as people walked from settlements to fields/pastures over centuries\n\n  \u003e Ex. “hollow ways” or trackways in Syria (over 14000 settlements discovered using this method)\n\n#### Ground Reconnaissance(侦查)\n\n- “Ground truthing”; **pedestrian survey**; field walking; **isolated artifacts on the ground surface**; changes in soil/vegetation\n\n  \u003e Ex.  Prince Rupert Harbour in B.C., with lack of trees implying an ancient village); tree throws; exposed erosional face\n\n#### Geophysics(地质物理学) in Archaeology\n\n- The science of the physical properties of the Earth and its surroundings. Helps identify subsurface features prior to excavation; radar waves sent into ground and bounce back off of buried objects\n\n  \u003e Ex: Ground Penetrating Radar (Prof. Patton’s example of searching for old graveyard of escaped US slaves in southwestern Ontario)\n  \u003e\n  \u003e Ex: Ness of Brodgar: first identified using Ground Penetrating Radar; predates Stonehenge (on the Orkney Islands in northern Scotland)\n\n- Excavation: \n\n  - **Vertical:** test pits or trenches that reveal stratification (or stratigraphy)\n  - **Horizontal:** area excavations. Good for seeing arrangement of features\n\n### Site Grid\n\n- Facilitates documentation of provenience and mapping; **breaks site up into small units** (1x1m, 2x2m, etc.); site datum\n- \u003cu\u003eProvenience\u003c/u\u003e: place of origin;

radiocarbon dating (C14); radiopotassium (or potassium-argon) dating; dendrochronology\n- \u003cu\u003eRadiocarbon Dating\u003c/u\u003e: good for **wood, shell, animal bones**, antler; C14 unstable carbon isotope; half-life of 5730 years; plants absorb CO2; animals eat plants; when plants or animals die, intake of carbon stops; C14 begins to decay; \n  - \u003cu\u003eCalibration\u003c/u\u003e: C14 dates must be **calibrated** to account for changes in the amount of C14 in atmosphere through time; \n    - Calibrated dates: C14 dates that have been “corrected” to calendar years\n- \u003cu\u003eRadiopotassium Dating\u003c/u\u003e: also called potassium-argon; measures ratio of radioactive potassium-40 to argon-40 in rocks and minerals (both radioactive)\n- **The context of strata, artifacts, features, etc. is critical to understanding the past**\n\n## Time in Long History (Prehistory):\n\n- [Miocene (23.0 – 5.3 MYA)](##Miocene-(23.0-–-5.3 MYA)) - existence of earliest bipedal ancestors;

long-term use of specific tools\n\n\n\u003e ##### Understanding purpose of stone tools:\n\u003e\n\u003e - \u003cu\u003eContext\u003c/u\u003e: found in **association with animal bones with cut marks** (butchery); other marks could signal hunting over scavenging; microscopic wear; experimental archaeology\n\u003e - *What earliest tools reveal about older hominins:* \n\u003e   - **Problem solving**; manual dexterity(灵巧), Created a technology that becomes critical for adaptation; **abstract** idea of tool, **knowledge** of steps to make it; **learning** (social behaviours and communication); **social engagement** of multiple individuals\n\n#### Acheulean: \n\n- Lithic industry associated with [*H. erectus*](###*==Homo Erectus==*-[Asia-and-Southeast-Asia-1.8 MYA-–-27-KYA])\n- **Handaxe**; symmetrical and bifacially worked; 1.8 MYA – 200 KYA\n- **Multi-purpose tool**; cutting, sawing, digging, bashing, boring; St. Acheul gravel pits, France; 1859 (tools at St. Acheul dated 500 – 300 KYA)\n\n\u003e ##### Cites related to this\n\u003e\n\u003e - *Zhoukoudian*: Davidson Black, 1927; *Sinanthropus pekinensis*; further excavations revealed remains of multiple individuals dating 700 – 200 KYA; **no handaxes**\n\u003e - *Boxgrove*: in the UK; attributed to *H. heidelbergensis*; believed to be first hominin in Europe; over 250 handaxes found; some appear to not have been used at all\n\n#### Hunting.  400KYA, 500KYA\n\n- **Cooperation** is a huge element of human evolution; may have been needles that serve as evidence of tailoring, for hominins living in colder climates\n\n  \u003e *Schöningen*, Germany -\u003e 400 KYA;

more of a stone element (stone foundations) [支持久坐或半固定的人口]\n\n#### Roasting culture vs boiling culture peoples\n\n- Natufians and Near East farmers are roasting culture\n  - Natufian Example: *Abu Hereyra*: 13.5KYA; good gazelle-hunting location; seasonal use of wild plants and animals; semi-sedentary to year-round occupation; storage pits = “delayed return”; sub-floor burial of the dead\n    - Abu Hureyra as a farming settlement: re-occupied PPNB (pre-pottery Neolithic B) (10.5 – 8.7KYA); 5000-6000 people\n- Göbekli Tepe*: Holocene: current geological epoch; starts ca. 11.7KYA; not the only example of stone architecture from that time period in the Near East; Göbekli Tepe can be interpreted as **“Houses”** (structures associated with lineages)\n\n#### How do we know a plant is domesticated? \n\n- Domesticated plants have: **tough rachis; larger seeds; different genetic signature**\n\n### Farming in Europe: \n\n- Southeast Europe (8500 years ago); Central and Western Europe (7500 years ago); Britain and North Europe (6000 years ago); \n  - DNA evidence suggests migration of people from Middle East; migrants brought grains, animals\n- *Linear Band Keramik (LBK)* 7200 – 6500 years ago: long, rectangular houses; Middle Danube area, central Europe\n- *Talheim* (6900 years ago): massacre site; men, women, and children; farmer-farmer violence, not farmer vs hunter-gatherer, as previously believed\n- *Talianky*: Cucuteni-Trypillia culture; 5850 – 5700 years old (Neolithic); Ukraine (Eurasian Steppe); huge farming town, population around 10 000; 200 such settlements in and around the Ukraine; were able to make two-story houses that were plastered on the inside, and painted; seemed to have been burned to the ground by the inhabitants every 60-80 years\n\n### Neolithic in Northern and Western Europe: 6000 – 5000 years ago;\n\n- Earthen Long Barrows; example: West Kennet Long Barrow, on Salisbury Plain\n- Early Neolithic (Orkney): Maeshowe (4800 years old); chambered tomb\n- Ring of Brodgar: 5200 years ago: near Maeshowe; one of the **earliest stone circles in the UK**\n- **\u003cu\u003eNess of Brodgar\u003c/u\u003e**: predates Stonehenge; shows that places that seem isolated today (like the Orkneys) were very important 5000 years ago; at least 10 massive stone structures; places of residence and ritualroduced more art than any other Neolithic site in the UK\n- \u003cu\u003eSkara Brae\u003c/u\u003e: farming village composed of semi-subterranean houses, with tunnels between houses; fisher-farmers\n- \u003cu\u003eGrooved Ware\u003c/u\u003e: pottery made in Orkneys; both for everyday and ritual use; mostly used to serve food and drink; this style also found on Salisbury Plain; similar motifs to those found on passage graves in Ireland\n- Salisbury Plain (Stonehenge): built between 5000 – 3500 years ago; burial ground (mostly cremations), not everyone could be buried there though\n\n### Africa\n\n- Northeast Africa: tef, millet, coffee\n- Central Africa: millet, sorghum (ca. 8000 years ago)\n- West Africa: rice\n\n#### Hunter-Gatherers in North Africa:\n\n- Sahara was much wetter 14KYA than it is today (late Pleistocene);

AD 1050; at least 12 such great houses inside the canyon, over 100 outside the canyon\n\n#### Great Houses\n\n- Multi-storied structures (largest is up to 5 stories tall with over 500 rooms); plazas; kivas (one structure has around 17)\n- Built with astronomical alignment (align with phases of the sun/ cycle of the moon); seen as important trade centre for Mexican goods (copper, cacao, macaws)\n- No evidence for domestic activities; found evidence for storage; likely houses for a few elite families; enormous amounts of turquoise found\n\n#### Influence of Mexico\n\n- Similar architectural style to that of northern Mexico; evidence of cacao plant\n- Chaco Influence: Northeast and Eastern extremes marked by Great Houses; example: Chimney Rock\n- Cahokia: 3 sprawling urban centres near border of Illinois/Missouri; AD 1054; “Big Bang”; 10k to 15k people in Cahokia; surrounding area: 40k\n- Downtown Cahokia: Monks Mound and Plaza; laid out among cosmological principles; surfaces alternate between clay and sand; thought to improve durability\n\n#### Cahokia believed to be at centre of Mississippian world\n\n- Mississippian Material Culture: Ramey-incised vessels; triangular points: serrated edge points; shell from Gulf Coast; sinistral or lightening whelk","lastmodified":"2023-05-10T19:08:03.562968305Z","tags":["Note"]},"/UofT-Notes/ANT100/ANT100-Lecture_25":{"title":"ANT100: Lecture_25","content":"\n# Urbanism\n\n`April 1`\n\nV. Gordon Childe: \n\n## The Urban Revolution\n\n- Close relationship between city and the state, according to Childe\n- 10 criteria for early states; size and large population; full-time specialists; agricultural surplus; monumental architecture; long-distance trade; writing; ruling elites and class-based; taxation; control of labour; some traits present in non-cities, and some cities don’t have these traits\n  - Chris Gosden and Aggregation: urbanism as a process; part of aggregation: linked to power (sacred and secular); not necessarily social inequality; competing lineages; example of Talianky, a Neolithic aggregation site on the Russian Steppe\n- *Catalhoyuk*: 9100 to 7700 years ago; in central Turkey; farmers, but also rely on hunting animals; like Abu Hereyra and Natufian, people practice sub-floor burial; no indication of social inequality; households are the centre of production\n\n### Urbanism in *Mesopotamia*:\n\n- Tigris and Euphrates rivers (modern-day Iraq); first sites agreed to be cities; structures built out of reeds and mud; fertile soils allowed for large-scale agriculture; process of urbanization begins ca. 7000 years ago; Ubaid culture; term used by archaeologists to describe this period of time, first temple centres; temple centres; region-wide belief system; control of ritual, trade, and irrigation; no settlement hierarchy\n- *Eridu*: one of the most important temple centres; kingship was first given to the humans at this site\n\n### Urbanization in *Mesopotamia*:\n\n- 6000 years ago: city-states; Uruk: the first city; 20 000 – 40 000 people (very densely populated); authority over smaller cities and towns in region; temples become massive land-holding establishments; palace (*Ensi*); city council (selected a new king when needed\n- *Cuneiform*: earliest form of writing; possibly invented in Uruk itself; could be used to write several different languages; since characters represented syllables; mostly used for administrative purposes\n- \u003cu\u003eHammurabi’s Code\u003c/u\u003e (3800 years ago): first written law code in the world; talks about perjury, robbery, marriage, adoption, ownership of slaves, costs for hiring an ox, etc.; shows authority of Mesopotamian kings\n- \u003cu\u003eEpic of Gilgamesh\u003c/u\u003e: **one of the first, if not the first, works of literature**; written in Cuneiform on 12 clay tablets; tells the story of Gilgamesh and Enkidu, whom God sends to humble Gilgamesh; they become friends, then Enkidu’s death leads Gilgamesh to search for eternal life\n- \u003cu\u003eCylinder Seals\u003c/u\u003e: appear around 6000 years ago in Uruk; stone seals rolled across mud/clay; become very elaborate over time; display stories/myths/historical events\n- \u003cu\u003eRuling Class\u003c/u\u003e: pronounced social inequality in Mesopotamia; large tombs in the cemetery at Ur\n\n### Urbanization/Ruralization\n\n- Around 80% of the population of Mesopotamia lived in cities\n- Indus Valley (Harappan) Civilization (2600 – 1900 BC): near Pakistan-India border; sites from Iran to Delhi; much larger area than Egypt or Mesopotamia; 5 large Indus Valley cities, 2/3 to be discussed in lecture\n- \u003cu\u003eMelluhan\u003c/u\u003e: sea trade between Mesopotamia and the Indus Valley, documented as old as 5000 years ago; Mesopotamian texts refer to Melluhan (Indus Valley civilization) as an important trade partner\n- Mohenjo Daro: 4000 – 5000 years old (starts to emerge as a major urban centre ca. 4500 years ago); largest city of the Indus; series of neighbourhoods/compounds (each neighbourhood was walled; some suggestion that each was founded at slightly different times); acropolis/citadel (westernmost mound; may have been used for public gatherings, may be some sort of wealthy lineage associated with it); 2 and 3 storey buildings; constructed public wells and toilets; both inside and outside houses; particular emphasis on trade and production of goods; elites appear to gain prestige/wealth because of their role as merchants\n- Indus cities: very elaborate drainage system; thousands of years before Rome\n- Chert Weights: cubical weights in gradual sizes; show up in all settlements; largest weight is 100x the weight of the smallest; may have been used for controlling trade, or collecting taxes\n- Mohenjo Daro: The Great Bath: some of the earliest water tanks in the ancient world\n- Harappa and Mohenjo Daro: granaries: no evidence for storage of agricultural surplus; believed to be a large public building, of unknown purpose\n- Indus Valley Rulers: no evidence for monuments to elite power; no depictions of warfare; few graveyards, and graves do not contain many goods; elites distinguished through where they live, and through seals; writing system not known; appear to have access to materials to make ornaments; such as shells or beads; compounds: competing families; merchants, controlling trade and manufacture of goods; religion\n- Dholavira: some structures may be interpreted as palaces; still very different from Mesopotamia or Egypt\n\n### Urbanism in China\n\n- Xia Dynasty (3800 years ago, near the Yellow River); Erlitou seems to be the biggest of the city-states that emerged; seems to be on top of the hierarchy; acts almost like a capital; bronze-making plays a large role; site of Erlitou includes large palace complex at its core; evidence of craft production; not many people living in these cities; evidence for increasing warfare, increased trade, regional/shared ideology, and movement of people\n- Shang China: capital at Anyang; territorial state; city itself still not densely populated\n- Oracle Bones, writing, and bronzes; oracle bones wound up on the antiquities market, were traced back to a deposit; some of the earliest Chinese texts; used to communicate with ancestors; controlled by kings and elites\n- Shang Tombs: royal tombs at Anyang; only one such tomb found unlooted; contained many artifacts, as well as human sacrifices\n- Indian Ocean as conduit for people and things: sea connections between the civilizations mentioned above\n\n### Great Zimbabwe\n\n- Sub-Saharan African state; trade with cities on Indian Ocean starting 1000 AD; wealth based on trade of gold and ivory; one of 200 of these sites; built with stone architecture; no mortar used; enclosures appear to be residences of elite lineages; no evidence for elaborate burials, or writing system; may have held between 10 000 – 20 000 people; Shadrek Chirikure and Innocent Pikiyari: enclosures are houses of successive rulers; Shona political succession; succession alternates among ruling houses; each ruler rules from own house; apartheid-like system in colonial Zimbabwe; colonial rulers believed Great Zimbabwe was built by peoples from the Middle East; this was supported using propaganda; several soapstone figures found, including one of a bird, which now appears on Zimbabwe’s flag\n\n### Urbanism in West Africa\n\n- Bassey Andah (late 20th century); studied farming and urbanism in West Africa; critical of colonial context of archaeology in Africa; archaeology as a means of developing African consciousness; argued that towns followed a distinct African trajectory; earliest towns were local developments, and showed little evidence for social inequality, despite being densely populated\n- \u003cu\u003eWest African Urbanism:\u003c/u\u003e Yoruba; Benin city; Ghana; possible emerging settlement hierarchy; process of urbanization may have begun around 3000 years ago, with the above cities emerging by the 10th century\n\n### Urbanism in the Americas: \n\n- Caral: modern-day Peru, about 6200 years old, evidence for maize domestication; not the only such site, rather one of several; such sites often described as proto-urban\n- Mesoamerica: the Olmec; settlement hierarchy organized around regal-ritual centres; control of trade; elites living there, not many non-elite residents\n- Zapotec: Monte Alban (2500 years ago): transformed mountaintop; evidence for specialized administrative structures; residential areas sprawl around central area; up to 17 000 inhabitants at its peak; most cities have a sacred ceremonial precinct\n- Teotihuacan Culture: large urban centre emerges approx. 2000 years ago; largest city to Mesoamerica prior to Aztec Tenochtitlan; up to 80 000 people living in it, possibly more; could have held up to 100 000 people; trade, particularly in obsidian; 2.5km route through Teotihuacan, referred to as the “Avenue of the Dead”, as named by the Aztecs; Teotihuacan was the city of the gods to the Aztecs; evidence of obsidian workshops, as well as human sacrifices, likely war captives\n- Classic Maya, 250 to 900 CE: Teotihuacan leaders established some Mayan cities, such as Tikal; depopulation of the countryside; most people living in the city; possible farming in the city, based on layout\n\n### Urbanism in North America (pre-colonial): \n\n- Cahokia (approx. 10 000 people at its height); centred around a flat-topped, 4-sided pyramid, with a central plaza; founding of Cahokia linked to ritual as well as agriculture","lastmodified":"2023-05-10T19:08:03.562968305Z","tags":["Note"]},"/UofT-Notes/ANT100/ANT100-Lecture_26":{"title":"ANT100: Lecture_26","content":"\n# The present past\n\n`April 8`\n\n- The past is often contested\n\n  \u003e “Who controls the past controls the future; who controls the present controls the past” - **George Orwell**, 1984\n\n### What is Heritage? \n\n\u003e “Heritage is a property – something that is passed down from previous generations. Cultural heritage consists of the cultures, values, and traditions of a particular community, group, or nation. Cultural heritage can be comprised of tangible things such as artifacts, artwork, and buildings, or intangible things, such as language, dances, and stories. Regardless of whether it is tangible or intangible, cultural heritage reflects the human aspects of our communities that shape who we are and how we interact with the world around us.” -**Joe Watkins**\n\n- \u003cu\u003eArchaeology\u003c/u\u003e: “preservation-by-record” (Hoberg et al. 2017)\n  - Preservation of information: subtractive and irreversible; \n- \u003cu\u003eHeritage\u003c/u\u003e: “preservation in site” (Hoberg et al. 2017)\n  - Conservation; memory and emotional responses; architecture, monuments, sacred sites, archaeological places; “that which may be inherited”; central to discussions of cultural identity\n- \u003cu\u003ePower and Heritage\u003c/u\u003e: weaponized: to deny or promote a particular narrative; destroyed; contested in terms of interpretation and ownership\n\n### Monuments and Memorials\n\n- **Monuments** are also public art; not neutral or objective; usually put up by organizations wanting to promote a specific narrative about the past; Confederate monuments put up during Reconstruction or Civil Rights era, not by coincidence\n- Assimilation and “vanishing native” myth. Example: “Moundbuilder Myth”: idea started by scholars documenting North American earthworks; were up to 10 000 at some point; idea that natives were not sophisticated enough to build the mounds, and outsiders built them; taught in US schools until myth was overturned in the 1890s\n\n### Archaeology, Heritage, and Development\n\n- Cultural resource management (CRM); compliance archaeology; salvage archaeology; development is a huge threat to archaeology; assessment must be undertaken before development, to determine value and significance of potential archaeological finds); state opinions on significance may differ from other opinions\n- Juukan Gorge, Western Australia: destroyed by mining company, despite being considered sacred by Aboriginal Australians; evidence for human inhabitancy ca. 46 KYA\n- Jemseg Crossing Archaeology Project: Jemseg, New Brunswick: Excavated prior to twinning and rerouting of Trans-Canada Highway; community-engaged project in Wolastoqey homeland; initially set to be excavated, but discovery of an ancient burial changed that; considered significant by both archaeologists and Indigenous peoples\n- Who are the stewards of the past? Who owns the past? Who gets to decide what gets excavated and what doesn’t? Who determined site interpretation? Who “owns” artifacts? In Canada, artifacts are held “in trust” for Canadians (by provincial repositories; different in Ontario)\n\n### Indigenous Critiques of Archaeology: \n\n- Vine Deloria “Anthropologists and Other Friends” (Custer died for your sins); colonial process; critique of people as objects of study; research of no benefit to Indigenous communities; artifacts and information were removed; money spent on projects should be better used to help Indigenous communitie\n\n#### Ethics and Legislation: \n\n- United States: NAGPRA (Native American Graves Protection and Reparation Act)\n- 1990; **repatriation** of human remains, funerary and sacred objects (not all, but those deemed significant) Canada: province-by-province basis; each institution has its own policies on repatriation\n- The Ancient One (Kennewick Man): ca. 8500 years old; Kennewick, Washington; discovered by two men in 1996, eroding along a riverbank; initially believed to be remains of a European settler, based on skull morphology; part of a cascade point discovered embedded in the man’s hip; point dated 8500 years ago; claim that Kennewick Man was not related to modern Indigenous peoples, contrary to their claims; genetic analysis confirmed that the remains were indeed related to the Indigenous groups\n\n\u003e Canadian Example: Rainey River Mounds Repatriation: repatriation of human remains and artifacts excavated in 1950s and 1960s near Rainey River; artifacts now at museums owned by descendant communities\n\n- \u003cu\u003eIndigenous Archaeologies\u003c/u\u003e: shift in power away from researchers and towards descendant communities; draws on multi lines of evidence and centres non-archaeological ways of knowing (i.e., Indigenous ways of knowing); it requires rigorous methods, analyses, and interpretations, just like good scholarship anywhere; “two-eyed seeing”; “braided knowledge”\n- Archaeology in the cause of **\u003cu\u003eNationalism\u003c/u\u003e**: beginnings of archaeology as discipline during the rise of Nation States in late 19th century; ancient past became central to new identity; example: Germany (post-WWI); 1920s, ethnic regions of Europe identified by archaeological remains: German ancestry rooted in prehistory of Central Europe\n- \u003cu\u003eAhnenerbe\u003c/u\u003e: research organization established by Himmler;

12th century Benedictine monks carved rooms into the stone; Ahnenerbe excavation to find “Germanic temple”; interpreted as place of worship for cult of the sun; cited as an example of Germany’s glorious past\n- *Thingstätten*: established in places where “significant Germanic occupation” demonstrated through archaeology; intended to show German cultural continuity through time\n- Dolni Vestonice: Silvia Tomaskova; Moravia: was a German-speaking area during Austro-Hungarian Empire and Czechoslovakia; two kilns; 2300 clay figurines; clay pellets and slabs; bird bone flutes; 25 000 years old\n- Dolni Vestonice: putting Czechoslovakia on the map: Karel Absolon, 1924: large-scale horizontal excavation; compared with Pompeii, King Tut’s tomb; Czechoslovakia and Moravia in the study of human origins; new nation with rich archaeological history like other European nations; massive mammoth hunting site and settlement (houses built of mammoth bone); concluded that all Northern peoples must have originated from northern peoples in Czechoslovakia\n- Dolni Vestonice becomes Unterwisternitz: 1939: Ahnenerbe takes over excavations; Bohmers: to “correct” earlier work; wanted to trace “Nordic” (German) past to the Paleolithic; focus on art objects to understand worldview of peoples who “conquered” Europe and vanquished Neanderthals; site becomes an Indo-German village\n- Great Zimbabwe: urban centre ca. 1000-1500 AD; Cecil Rhodes finances excavation to “prove” Great Zimbabwe could not have been built by Africans (must have been foreigners); official interpretation until 1979\n- International trade in artifacts and repatriation: the Elgin Marbles; one of many examples where artifacts were acquired, with conflict between the involved parties\n- The bust of Nefertiti: excavated in Egypt, taken to museum in Germany; Egypt wants it returned, Germany refuses\n- History of Looting: tombs of Pharaohs moved to Valley of the Kings to protect them from looting, which wasa big problem even back then; King Tut’s tomb was very significant due to lack of looting\n- International Conventions: the 1954 Hague Convention on Preserving Cultural Heritage; the 1970 UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export, and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property; will not loot sites during warfare, and will not allow looted material to enter/leave their borders\n- Archaeology and Mesopotamia: Mesopotamia viewed as the cradle of Western civilization; modern states have drawn on this history to promote narratives; excavations of Ur attracted many people, including Agatha Christie; Syrian and Iraqi leaders took control of archaeological sites after independence; ancient history became part of modern states’ identity; one of Saddam Hussein’s palaces built in the style of a ziggurat, and overlooks Babylonian ruins\n- Looting, Destruction, and ISIS: performance (for attention); to anger “the West”; emphasizes the overthrowing of old political order of Nation States; destroying “idols” of nationalism (Christopher Jones, 2018)Looted Artifacts and Insurgences: ISIS known to sell looted artifacts; estimated to have made between $4 million – 7 billion this way","lastmodified":"2023-05-10T19:08:03.562968305Z","tags":["Note"]},"/UofT-Notes/ANT100/ANT100-Lecture_34":{"title":"ANT100: Lecture_3\u00264","content":"\n# Signifying Reality\n\n\u003e Dive **under the surface**, and ask question about the \"obvious\" \n\n### Readings\n\n- All languages appear to have nouns and verbs\n- Humans are programmed to easily process certain kind of language rules\n  - Need not be spoken\n  - Its independent of the way we express it\n- Language need not to be communicated (internal speech)\n  - Reflects the way we speak with others\n  - Other understanding of the world is aided by both the internal speech \u0026 social understanding\n- Linguistic and semiotic anthropology are disciplines that study the role of signs in human cultural and society\n\n## ==How signs represent our world (semiotics)==\n\n- Human's reality is constructed by our use of signs\n\n- \u003cu\u003eSignification\u003c/u\u003e(verb) - making sense, making signs \n  - Linguistic and non-linguistic signs\n- Homo sapiens - \"human that knows\" (**making sense == to signify**)\n- **\u003cu\u003eSemiotics\u003c/u\u003e** - study of signs (signifiying)\n  - \u003cu\u003eLinguistics\u003c/u\u003e - study of language (**part of semiotics**)\n  - Other signs (semiotics proper)\n\n## The form fo signs (signifier and the signified)\n\n- Classic (\"*Saussurean*\") View of Signification (Ferdinand de Saussure)\n  - **\u003cu\u003eSignifier\u003c/u\u003e** - has some **physical property**(audio, visual, writing)\n  - **\u003cu\u003eSignified\u003c/u\u003e** - in material (not in semiotic language, **ordinary language**)\n\n### Sign = Signifier + Signified (3 quality of signs, a sign can have more than one qualities)\n\n- ==\u003cu\u003eIcon\u003c/u\u003e== - share some of their physical form (shape, sound...\n\n  \u003e Ex.

As we described above, this causes each call to `_insert` to take $i$ steps.\n    - This gives a total running time for this input family of $\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$, which is $\\Theta(n^2)$, matching the upper bound on the worst-case running time.\n  - Therefore the *worst-case* running time for `insertion_sort` is $\\Theta(n^2)$\n\n## Selection sort vs. Insertion sort\n\n- Both selection sort and insertion sort are *iterative* sorting algorithms, meaning they are implemented using a loop.\n- The action inside each loop iteration as being divided into two phases: \n  1. Selecting which remaining item to add to the sorted part\n  2. Adding that item to the sorted part.\n- Running time is similar, but it is actually, is very different\n  - Selection sort **always** takes $\\Theta(n^2)$\n  - Insertion sort has a **worst-case** running time of $\\Theta(n^2)$, but it could takes short time\n- Insertion sort is preferable because of its potential to be more efficient on many different input lists","lastmodified":"2023-05-10T19:08:03.562968305Z","tags":["Note"]},"/UofT-Notes/CSC111/CSC111-11_Divide-and-Conquer":{"title":"CSC111: 11_Divide-and-Conquer","content":"\n\n\n# Divide and Conquer Algorithms\n\n## Introduction to Divide-and-Conquer Algorithms\n\n- \u003cu\u003eDivide-and-conquer algorithms\u003c/u\u003e  - splitting the task up into subtasks can make it easier to manage\n\n  1.

(For simplicity, assume $n$ is a power of 2)\n  - In the recursive step, divide the list, each sublist has length of $\\frac{n}{2}$, then recurse on each one. Then this would result in a length of $\\frac{n}{4}$\n  - Following this pattern, for each call to `mergesort` with a list of length $\\frac{n}{2^k}$ for some $k \\in \\N$, get 2 resultant sublist of length $\\frac{n}{2^{k+1}}$. The base case is reached when the call has a list length of 1\n-  For non-recursive running time. Consider a list `lst` with length $n$, where $n \\ge 2$, assume $n$ is power of 2 (ignores floors and ceilings)\n   -  The IF condition check `len(lst) \u003c 2` and the calculation fo `mid` takes constant time\n      - If $n \u003c 2$ base case executes, which is constant time\n   -  List slicing operations`lst[:mid]` and `list[mid:]` takes time proportional tot he length of the slice, which is $\\frac{n}{2}$\n   - So in the recursive step, `left_sorted` and `right_sorted` each have some $\\frac{n}{2}$, running time of `_merge` is then $\\frac{n}{2} + \\frac{n}{2} = n$ steps\n   - So the total is $1 + \\frac{n}{2} + \\frac{n}{2} + n = 2n + 1$ where $n \\ge 2$\n\n#### Putting it together\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/008eGmZEly1gpbk4z7qnrj30ny0g3mxg.jpg\" alt=\"mergesort-recursion-tree-full\" style=\"zoom:38%;\" /\u003e\n\n1. The initial `mergesort` call on a list of length $n$ takes $n$ steps\n2. Each of the recursive calls on a list of length $\\frac{n}{2}$ takes $\\frac{n}{2}$ steps. Then each of the call on a list of length $\\frac{n}{4}$ takes $\\frac{n}{4}$ steps\n3. This pattern continues, until reach the base case, which takes 1 step\n\n- Adding up all the numbers (key observation, each *level* in the tree has nodes with the same running time, and since this is binary tree, the number of nodes at any depth is easy to find)\n  - At depth $d$ in the tree, there are $2^d$ nodes, and each node contains the number $\\frac{n}{2^d}$\n  - When adding the nodes at at each depth , get $2^d \\cdot \\frac{n}{2^d}=n$. \n  - In other words, ***each level* in the tree, it has the same total running time**\n- There are a total of $\\log_2 (n)+1$ levels in total. Get the total running then is $n \\cdot (\\log_2 (n)+1$\n- **This result in $\\Theta(n \\log n)$,** this is much better then worst case  $\\Theta(n^2)$ for selection and insertion sort\n\n## Quicksort\n\n- \u003cu\u003eQuicksort\u003c/u\u003e - second divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm (**Non-mutating** version) \n  1. First pick one one element from the input list, which we call the **pivot**. Then, we split up the list into two parts: the elements less than or equal to the pivot, and those greater than the pivot. This is traditionally called the *partitioning* step.\n  2. Next, we sort each part recursively.\n  3. Finally, we concatenate the two sorted parts, putting the pivot in between them.\n\n```python\ndef quicksort(lst: list) -\u003e list:\n    \"\"\"Return a sorted list with the same elements as lst.\n\n    This is a *non-mutating* version of quicksort; it does not mutate the\n    input list.\n    \"\"\"\n    if len(lst) \u003c 2:\n        return lst.copy()\n    else:\n        # Divide the list into two parts by picking a pivot and then partitioning the list.\n        # In this implementation, we're choosing the first element as the pivot, but\n        # we could have made lots of other choices here (e.g., last, random).\n        pivot = lst[0]\n        smaller, bigger = _partition(lst[1:], pivot)\n\n        # Sort each part recursively\n        smaller_sorted = quicksort(smaller)\n        bigger_sorted = quicksort(bigger)\n\n        # Combine the two sorted parts. No need for a helper here!\n        return smaller_sorted + [pivot] + bigger_sorted\n```\n\n- Using a helper partition function\n\n  ```python\n  def _partition(lst: list, pivot: Any) -\u003e tuple[list, list]:\n      \"\"\"Return a partition of lst with the chosen pivot.\n  \n      Return two lists, where the first contains the items in lst\n      that are \u003c= pivot, and the second contains the items in lst that are \u003e pivot.\n      \"\"\"\n      smaller = []\n      bigger = []\n  \n      for item in lst:\n          if item \u003c= pivot:\n              smaller.append(item)\n          else:\n              bigger.append(item)\n  \n      return (smaller, bigger)\n  ```\n\n### Running time analysis\n\n- The non-recursive part of `quicksort` is $\\Theta(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the input list. (This for the list slicing part, other statements takes constant time)\n\n- `quicksort` also always makes two recursive calls, on its two partitions. (Also result in binary tree)\n\n- However, the two partitions does not always have the same length, it **depends of the choice of pivot** \n\n  - If pivot is median of the list, 2 partitions has a size $\\frac{n}{2}$, which results in $\\Theta(n \\log n)$ (**minimum**)\n\n  - If the pivot is the smallest element, then the `smaller` partition has no elements whereas the `bigger` partition have all remaining of $n-1$ elements. (This is the **maximum** running time)\n\n     \u003cimg src=\"https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/008eGmZEly1gpbkhrxrwnj30me0jk0t1.jpg\" alt=\"quicksort-unbalanced-tree\" style=\"zoom:38%;\" /\u003e $\\left(\\sum_{i = 1}^n  i\\right) + (n-1) = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} + n-1 \n    \\Rightarrow \\Theta(n^2)$\n\n  - **This means `quicksort` has a running time range from $\\Theta(n \\log n)$ to $\\Theta(n^2)$**\n\n## Mergesort vs. Quicksort\n\n- Both mergesort and quicksort are recursive sorting algorithms based on the *divide-and-conquer* paradigm.\n  - For mergesort, the “divide” step is simple, since the input list is simply split in half. **The “combine” step is the hard part**, where we use a clever `_merge` helper to merge the two sorted lists together.\n  - For quicksort, **the “divide” step is the complex one**, where the input list is partitioned into two parts based on comparing the items to a chosen pivot value. But once that’s done, the “combine” step is simple: we cna just concatenate the results.\n- The asymptotic Theta notion simplifies the running-time analysis, which also *flattens* the reported running times.\n  - In practice, an *in-place* implementation of quicksort can be significantly faster than mergesort\n  - For most inputs, quicksort has “smaller constants” than mergesort, and performs fewer primitive machine operations than mergesort does.\n  - **Simply put, for most inputs quicksort is faster than mergesort, even though its worst-case running time is larger.**\n\n\u003e **What sorting algorithm do Python’s built-in `sorted` and `list.sort` functions use?!****\n\u003e\n\u003e It turns out that Python uses a sorting algorithm known as [**Timsort**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timsort), which was invented by Tim Peters in 2002 specifically for the Python programming language. You might be disappointed that we didn’t cover that algorithm in this course, but in fact, Timsort is essentially a highly optimized version of mergesort. Timsort uses the same basic idea of merging sorted sublists, but does so in a much smarter and more efficient way than our `mergesort` implementation, and adds a few tweaks based on empirical tests. One of those tweaks is switching to *insertion sort* to sort small sublists, which again reveals how our asymptotic worst-case running time doesn’t tell the full story.","lastmodified":"2023-05-10T19:08:03.562968305Z","tags":["Note"]},"/UofT-Notes/CSC111/CSC111-12_Average-Case-Running-Time":{"title":"CSC111: 12_Average-Case Running Time","content":"\n# Average-Case Running Time\n\n- In practice worst-case running time analysis can be misleading, with a variety of algorithms having a poor worst-case performance still yet performing well on the vast majority of inputs. \n\n- Let `func` be a program, for each $n \\in \\N$, define set $I_{func, n}$ to be the set of all inputs so `func` of size $n$.\n\n  - $$\n    WC_{func}(n) = \\max \\{\\text{running time of executing } \\texttt{func}(x)~\n    |~ x \\in I_{func, c} \\}\n    $$\n\n- **\u003cu\u003eAverage-case running time\u003c/u\u003e** of `func` is defined as the function $Avg_{\\texttt{func}}:  \\N \\to \\R^+$ where\n\n  - $$\n    Avg_{\\texttt{func}}(n) = \\frac{1}{|I_{func, n}|}~ \\times ~\n    \\sum_{x \\in I_{func, n}} \\text{ running time of } \\texttt{func}(x)\n    $$\n\n  - Need to precisely define \"all possible inputs of length $n$\" for the given function\n  - For infinite set of inputs is a common problem.

Tree size\n\n- Let $T$ be a tree, and let $size$ be a function mapping any tree to its size\n\n  - If $T$ is empty, then its size is 0: $size(T)=0$\n\n  - If $T$ is non-empty, then it consists of a root value and collection of subtrees $T_0, T_1, \\dots T_{k-1}$ (for some $k \\in \\N$). Then, the size of $T$ is the $sum$ of the sizes of its subtrees plus 1 for the root\n    $$\n    size(T) = 1 + \\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} size(T_i)\n    $$\n\n- Combine these two cases to write a recursive mathematical definition for $size$ function\n  $$\n  size(T) =\n  \\begin{cases}\n  0,  \u0026 \\text{ if } T \\text{ is empty} \\\\\n  1 + \\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} size(T_i)  \u0026 \n  \\text{ if } T \\text{ has subtrees } T_0, T_1, \\dots T_{k-1}\n  \\end{cases}\n  $$\n\n  ```python\n  class Tree:\n      def __len__(self) -\u003e int:\n          \"\"\"Return the number of items contained in this tree.\n          \n          \u003e\u003e\u003e t1 = Tree(None, [])\n          \u003e\u003e\u003e len(t1)\n          0\n          \u003e\u003e\u003e t2 = Tree(3, [Tree(4, []), Tree(1, [])])\n          \u003e\u003e\u003e len(t2)\n          3\n          \"\"\"\n          if self.is_empty():  # tree is empty\n              return 0\n          elif self._subtrees == []:  # tree is a single item\n              return 1\n          else:  # tree has at least one subtree\n              size_so_far = 1\n              for subtree in self._subtrees:\n                  size_so_far += subtree.__len__()\n              return size_so_far\n  ```\n\n### Ex. `Tree.__str__`\n\n- f-Strings format: `f'{variable}'` == `str.format(variable)`\n\n  ```python\n  \u003e\u003e\u003e name = \"Mel\"\n  \u003e\u003e\u003e f\"Hello, {name}\"\n  'Hello, Mel'\n  ```\n\n- Start with the value of root, then recursively add on the `__str__` for each of the subtrees\n\n- Base case returns an empty string\n\n- Pass in an extra parameter for the `depth` of the current tree, to add a corresponding number of indents before each value in the `str` that is returned\n\n- Make a \u003cu\u003e**parameter optional**\u003c/u\u003e by giving it a **default value**: `depth: int = 0` to define a default value for `depth`\n\n  - Since `depth` is optional, if assigned a specific value (ex. `t.__str__(5)`) then the depth would have the parameter to 5, otherwise, if not specified (ex. `t.__str__()`) then the depth parameter is assigned to 0\n  - All optional parameter must appear **after** all of the required parameters in the function header\n  - **DO NOT** use mutable values like lists for the optional parameters\n\n  ```python\n  def __str__(self, depth: int = 0) -\u003e str:\n      \"\"\"Return a string represention of this tree\n      \n      The indentation level is specified by the \u003cdepth\u003e parameter\n      \"\"\"\n      if self.is_empty():\n          return ''\n      else:\n          # use newlines ('\\n') to separate the different values\n          s = '\t' * depth +  f'{self.root}\\n'\n          for subtree in self._subtrees:\n              # the 'depth' argument to the recursive call is modified\n              s += subtree.__str__(depth + 1)  # equivalent ot str(subtree)\n          return s\n  ```\n\n#### Traversal orders\n\n- \u003cu\u003eLeft-to-right **preorder**\u003c/u\u003e \n\n  1.

Start with the recursion template, and impolite the base case:\n\n   ```python\n   class Tree:\n       def remove(self, item: Any) -\u003e bool:\n           \"\"\"...\"\"\"\n           if self.is_empty():\n               return False # item cannot be in the tree\n           else:\n               (...)\n               for subtree in self.subtrees:\n                   (...) subtree.method() (...)\n               (...)\n   ```\n\n2. First check the root, the if not, recurse on the subtrees\n\n   - Deleting the root requires a little more step, use `Tree._delete_root` to hold on for now\n   - Keep in mind that this function requires a return statement, include it in the recursions\n\n   ```python\n   class Tree:\n       def remove(self, item: Any) -\u003e bool:\n           \"\"\"...\"\"\"\n           if self.is_empty():\n               return False \n           elif: self._root == item:\n                   self._delete_root()  # delete the root\n           else:\n               for subtree in self.subtrees:\n                   deleted = subtree.remove(item)\n                   if deleted:\n                       return True\n               # The item does not appear in this tree\n               return False\n   ```\n\n3. Implement the `Tree._delete_root` function\n\n   - If this tree has subtrees, then the `_root` cannot be set to `None` (divide into cases)\n   - Pick the rightmost subtree, and \"promote\" its root and subtrees by moving them up a level\n\n   ```python\n   class Tree:\n       def _delete_root(self) -\u003e None:\n           \"\"\"Remove the root item of this tree.\n   \n           Preconditions:\n               - not self.is_empty()\n           \"\"\"\n           if self._subtrees == []:\n               self._root = None\n           else:\n               # Get the last subtree in this tree.\n               chosen_subtree = self._subtrees.pop()\n   \n               self._root = chosen_subtree._root\n               self._subtrees.extend(chosen_subtree._subtrees)\n   ```\n\n- Curren problem: when deleted a leaf, it would result in a empty tree (parent would contain an empty tree in its subtree list)\n\n4.

Thus worst-case running time is $\\Theta(h)$ \n\n#### BST height vs size\n\n- The height of a BST can be much smaller than its size\n- A BST with $n$ items, its height can be as large as $n$. Or as small as $\\log_2n$\n  - The height of tree $h$ can have size at most $2^h -1$ items. If store $n$ item in a BST, need $h \\ge \\log_2(n+1)$ to store all of them\n- If it can be guaranteed that BST always have height roughly $\\log_2n$, then in fact all three BST's operations (search, insert, delete) have a worst-case running time of $\\Theta(h)=\\Theta(\\log n)$. This is better than sorted list (search of $\\Theta(\\log n)$, with insert and delete at $\\Theta(n)$\n  - Under this assumption, BST are more efficient than Multiset ADT\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-05-10T19:08:03.562968305Z","tags":["Note"]},"/UofT-Notes/CSC111/CSC111-5_Abstract-Syntax-Trees":{"title":"CSC111: 5_Abstract Syntax Trees","content":"\n# Abstract Syntax Trees\n\n- Strings have a ***linear*** (a sequence of characters)\n- Programs have a naturally ***recursive*** structure.

If call `g.connected(1, 3)`, the program will first find the vertex corresponding to `1`, which can be called $v_1$. **Then the code would call `_Vertex.check_connected` on $v_1$ and `3`**. This is the problem\n    \u003cimg src=\"https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/008eGmZEly1goxzgscwhkj309w03cdfo.jpg\" alt=\"infinite-recursion\" style=\"zoom:38%;\" /\u003e\n    1. For $v_1$, `self.item ==1`, which is not `3`. This enters the recursive branch. \n    2. The only neighbour for $v_1$ is the vertex containing `2`, which can be called as $v_2$. Then the code would make a recursive call to `_Vertex.check_connected` of $v_2$ and `3`\n    3. For $v_2$, `self.item == 2`, which is not `3`. This again, enters the recursive branch. The only neighbour of $v_2$ is $v_1$, then it would make a recursive call on $v_1$ and `3` \n    4. For $v_1$ ...\n- \u003cu\u003eInfinite recursion\u003c/u\u003e - a code has expression a recursion computation that does not stop by reaching the base case\n    - In the above case, the Python interpreter alternates between calling the `Vertex.check_connected` with $v_1$ and `3` and with $v_2$ and `3`, and never stops\n    - This keeps adding a *stack frame* onto the function call stack, which at then would reach the limit the Python interpreter has set, and leads to a `RecursionError`\n\n\n### Fixing the recursion error\n- Modify the recursive condition: Given 2 vertices $v_1$ and $v_2$, they are connected when:\n    - $v_1 = v_2$ or \n    - There exists a neighbour $u$ of $v_1$ such that $u$ and $v_2$ are connected by a path **that does not use $v_1$**\n    - Achieve this by adding a `visited` parameter (which is already in the `Graph` code above)\n\n\n```Python\nclass _Vertex:\n    def check_connected(self, target_item: Any, visited: set[_Vertex]) -\u003e bool:\n        \"\"\"Return whether this vertex is connected to a vertex corresponding to the target_item,\n        WITHOUT using any of the vertices in visited\n\n        Preconditions:\n            - set not in visited\n        \"\"\"\n        if self.item == target_item:\n            return True\n        else:\n            visited.add(self)  # add self to the set of visited vertices \n            for u in self.neighbours:\n                # only recursive on vertices that haven't been visited\n                if u not in visited and u.check_connected(target_item, visited):\n                    return True\n\n            return False\n```\n\u003e But even though this implementation is correct, and much more efficient than the previous one, it does come with an important warning we want you to remember for the future. Whenever you use recursion with a mutable argument, be very careful when choosing whether to mutate that argument or create a modified copy—if you choose to mutate the argument, know that all recursive calls will mutate it as well!\n","lastmodified":"2023-05-10T19:08:03.562968305Z","tags":["Note"]},"/UofT-Notes/CSC111/CSC111-8_Cycles-and-Trees":{"title":"CSC111: 8_Cycles and Trees","content":"\n# Cycles and Trees\n\n### A \"Lower Bound\" for connectivity\n\n- What is the *minimum* number of edges required in a connected graph.\n- Any connected graph $G = (V, E)$ must have $|E| \\ge |V| - 1$\n- However, it is hard to prove this.\n\n\n## Cycles\n\n- \u003cu\u003eCycle\u003c/u\u003e - Let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph, a *cycle* in $G$ is a **sequence** of vertices $v_0, \\dots, v_k$ satisfying the following conditions\n    - $k \\ge 3$\n    - $v_0 = v_k$ and all other vertices are distinct from each other and $v_0$\n    - Each consecutive pair of vertices is adjacent\n- In other words, cycle is a path that starts and end at the same vertex\n- The length of a cycle is the number of edges used by the sequence, which is also the number of distinct vertices in the sequence (the above notation describes a cycle of length $k$)\n    \n    - Length has to be at least 3\n- \u003cu\u003e**Lemma**\u003c/u\u003e - Let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph, and $e \\in E$.

(Ex. V contains [1,1], spanV would contain [5,5],[0.5,0,5]... and also [1,1] as well] Therefore taking a span of the set would only enlarge the number of the vectors in the set. \n\n\u003e ##### Let $\\mathcal{V} \\subseteq \\R^2$ be the complete solution to $x + 2y =0$.

Basis are **not unique**. Every subspace (except the trivial subspace) has multiple bases\n  2. Given a basis for a subspace, every vector in the subspace can be written as a *unique* linear combination of vectors in that basis\n  3. Any two bases for the same subspace have the same number of elements\n\n  \u003e In other words, for every non-zero subspace, it is possible to find any linearly independent vectors in the span as representations of its bases. However, different representation of the basis would be linearly dependent.\n\n- \u003cu\u003eDimension\u003c/u\u003e - the dimension of a subspace $V$ is the number of elements in the basis of $V$ \n\n  - Tells the **maximum number of linearly independent vectors** that can exist in $V$\n  - The dimension fo the single point is 0 (A 0 dimensional point has no extendable x or y axis. Therefore it only shows the position of a point, there is no other possible extension of it)\n\n  \u003e **Here the definition of \"dimension\" is conflict-able with the day-to-day usage of the word \"dimension\" it in the past.** Normally, the word \"dimension\" is used similarly with the concept of $\\R^n$ space, while starting at this point, this non-rigorous definition is no longer valid in MAT223. Although the set A is in the $\\R^4$ space (a vector containing 4 elements), but it is defined as two dimensional (by the definition: the dimension of a subspace V is the number of elements in a basis for V). Therefore needs to be extra cautious about this new interpretation of dimension starting from here. \n\n\u003e ##### Let $A=\\{(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4) : x_1+2x_2 - x_3 = 0\\}$ and $x_1+6x_4=0$, find a basis for and the dimension of $A$\n\u003e\n\u003e $A$ Is the complete solution to the system\n\u003e $$\n\u003e \\left\\{\\begin{matrix} \n\u003e x_1 \u0026 +2x_2 -x_3 \u0026 \u0026= 0 \\\\ \n\u003e x_1 \u0026 \u0026 +6x_4 \u0026= 0  \\end{matrix}\\right.\n\u003e $$\n\u003e Which can be expressed in vector form as\n\u003e $$\n\u003e \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\x_3 \\\\ x_4 \\end{bmatrix} =\n\u003e t\\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1/2 \\\\1 \\\\0 \\end{bmatrix} \n\u003e +s\\begin{bmatrix} -6\\\\ 3 \\\\0 \\\\1 \\end{bmatrix}\n\u003e $$\n\u003e Therefore $A=\\text{span} \\left\\{ \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1/2 \\\\1 \\\\0 \\end{bmatrix} \n\u003e +\\begin{bmatrix} -6\\\\ 3 \\\\0 \\\\1 \\end{bmatrix} \\right \\}$ , since this is a linearly indecent set, with 2 elements, then $A$ is two dimensional.\n\n### Standard Basis\n\n- The \u003cu\u003estandard basis\u003c/u\u003e for $\\R^n$ is the set $\\{\\vec{e}_1, \\dots, \\vec{e}_n \\}$ where\n  $$\n  \\vec{e}_1 = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\0 \\\\ \\vdots \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad \n  \\vec{e}_2 = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\0 \\\\ \\vdots \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad\n  \\vec{e}_3 = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\1 \\\\ \\vdots \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad\n  \\dots\n  $$\n\n  - The notation $\\vec{e}_1$ is **context specific**, if $\\vec{e}_i \\in \\R^2$ then $\\vec{e}_i$ must have exactly two coordinates, if $\\vec{e}_1 \\in \\R^{25}$ then $\\vec{e}_i$ must have exactly 25 coordinates\n\n---\n\n- First This plane is a **translated plane**. In order for a subspace to have a basis. \n\n\n\nBy definition, a basis is a linearly independent subspace. In the definition of subspace, the vector space *must contain the zero vector.* In this case, this plane is a translated plane, which does not contain the zero vector. In order words, t**his plane does not have a straight forward basis.** \n\nTo calculate the \"basis\" of this plane, and additional set containing its transforming vector is needed. Therefore the \"basis\" of this plane would be:\n$$\nB = \\left\\{\\vec{a}, \\vec{b} \\right\\} + \\{\\vec{c} \\}\n$$\n\n\nFinn is correct about the linearly dependency property of the basis, and Darlene is right about the dimension of the basis. However, they both ignored the fact that this plane is a translated plane.

Planning for staffing needs,\n        2. Recruiting and hiring workers,\n        3. Providing for training and evaluating performance\n        4. Deciding on compensation and benefits\n        5. And overseeing employee separation.\n    - What are the three overall **objectives** of a human resource manager?\n        1. Providing qualified, well-trained employees for the organization\n        2. Maximizing employee effectiveness\n        3. Satisfying individual employee needs through monetary compensation.\n- How HR recruit and select employees\n    - Describe several recruiting techniques used by human resource managers.\n        - College and university job fairs\n        - Personal referrals\n        - Want ads\n        - Company websites\n        - Online job sites\n        - Podcast interviews (known as jobcasts) that feature hiring managers and employees talking about work at their companies.\n    - Is it unfair to firms that some questions cannot be asked during job interviews?\n        - The firm should be interested only in whether job applicants have the skills or experience to perform a certain job. Any interview questions should be concerned only with the job applicant’s abilities. The firm should be free to ask these questions.\n- Strategies for developing employees\n    - What are some common employee trainings and why?\n        - New employees often complete an orientation, also called *onboarding*, program where they learn about company policies and practices.\n        - Training programs provide opportunities for employees to **build their skills and knowledge**. These new skills can also prepare them for new job opportunities within the company.\n        - Training also helps employers to keep long-term, loyal, high-performing employees.\n        - Performance appraisals give employees feedback about their strengths and weaknesses and how they can improve.\n    - What are the benefits of computer-based training?\n        - Computer-based training offers **consistent presentations and interactive learning**. Employees can also learn at their own pace. Computer-based training is also **less expensive** than other types of training.\n    -  What is a management development program?\n        - *Management development program* provides training designed to improve the skills and broaden the knowledge of current and potential executives.\n    - What are the four criteria, or standards, of an effective performance appraisal?\n        1. A performance appraisal should take place several times a year\n        2. Be linked to organizational goals\n        3. Be based on objective measures\n        4. Be a two-way conversation.\n- Compensations\n    - What are some common compensations?\n        - Firms compensate employees with wages, salaries, incentive pay systems, and benefits. Benefit programs vary among firms, but most companies offer health care programs, insurance, retirement plans, and sick leave. More and more companies offer flexible benefit plans and flexible work plans, such as flextime, compressed workweeks, job sharing, and home-based work.\n    - Explain the difference between wage and salary.\n        - *Wages* are based on an hourly pay rate or the amount of work accomplished.\n        - *Salaries* are paid periodically, such as weekly or monthly. Salaries do not rise or fall with the number of hours worked.\n    -  What are flexible benefit plans? How do they work?\n        - Flexible benefit plans offer a **choice** of benefits, including different types of medical insurance, dental and vision benefits, and life and disability insurance. Typically, each employee receives a set allowance (also known as flex dollars) to pay for these benefits that suit his or her needs.\n- Employee separation, downsizing, outsourcing\n    - What is the difference between voluntary and involuntary turnover?\n        - *Voluntary turnover* occurs when employees leave firms for their own reasons, such as to start their own businesses, take jobs with other firms, move to another community, or retire.\n        - *Involuntary turnover* occurs because of employees’ poor job performance or unethical behaviour in their business practices or in the workplace. It can also occur when a company is forced to eliminate jobs.\n    -  What is downsizing? How is it different from outsourcing?\n        - *Downsizing* is the process of reducing the number of employees within a firm by eliminating jobs. Downsizing is done to cut overhead costs and streamline the organizational structure.\n        - *Outsourcing* occurs when companies contract with other firms to perform noncore jobs or business functions, such as housekeeping, maintenance, or relocation services. Outsourcing allows companies to focus on what they do best. It can also result in a downsized workforce.\n- Methods and theories of motivation\n    - Theories about motivation\n        - Employee motivation starts with high employee morale.\n        According to ,[[Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs]] people satisfy lower-order needs (such as food and safety) before moving to higher-order needs (such as esteem and fulfillment).\n        - Herzberg’s two-factor model of motivation is based on the fulfillment of hygiene factors and motivation factors.\n        - Expectancy theory suggests that people use these factors to decide whether to make the effort needed to complete a task.\n        - Equity theory refers to a person’s view of fair and equitable treatment.\n        - Goal-setting theory says that people will be motivated to the extent to which they accept specific, challenging goals.\n        - Job design is also used by managers for motivation.\n    - What are the four steps in the process of motivation?\n        - `Need --\u003e motivation --\u003e goal-directed behaviour --\u003e need satisfaction`\n    - Explain how goal-setting works.\n        - People will be motivated to the extent to which they accept specific, challenging goals and receive feedback that shows their progress toward goal achievement.\n    - Describe the three ways that managers design jobs for increased motivation.\n        1. *Job enlargement* is a job design that expands an employee’s responsibilities by increasing the number and variety of tasks.\n        2. *Job enrichment* changes the job duties to increase employees’ authority in planning their work, deciding how it should be done, and learning new skills that help them grow.\n        3. *Job rotation* involves a system of moving employees from one job to another.\n- Labour-management relations\n    - What is a labour union? What is collective bargaining?\n        A labour union is a group of workers who organize themselves to work toward common goals in the areas of wages, hours, and working conditions. Collective bargaining is the process of negotiation between management and union representatives.\n    -  What are the three main tactics used by unions to win support for their demands?\n        - Unions’ main tactics are strikes (walkouts), picketing, and boycotts.\n\n\n# Lecture\n\n- `PDF`:\n\n\u003e [[Strategic Human Resource Management]]\n\n- Google Work Environment\n    -\n       ```ad-example\n        - Work environment contribute to success?\n            - Creates more innovated staff members\n            - Relase cognitie load from food...

On the other side of the balance sheet are claims to assets, liabilities (what a firm owes), and owners’ equity (the owners’ investments in the firm). Claims are usually listed in the order in which they are due. For example, liabilities are listed before owners’ equity. Assets always equal liabilities plus owners’ equity.\n    - Define accrual accounting.\n        - *Accrual accounting* records **revenues and expenses when they _occur_, not when cash actually changes hands**. Most companies use accrual accounting to prepare their financial statements.\n- Financial ratios\n    - List the four categories of financial ratios.\n        1. Liquidity\n        2.

Cash receipts are listed first. They include cash sales and the collection of past credit sales. Cash outlays, or cash expenses, are listed next. These include cash purchases, payment of past credit purchases, and operating expenses. The difference between cash receipts and cash outlays is net cash flow.\n- Online accounting\n    - How are financial statements adjusted for exchange rates?\n        - An exchange rate is the value of one country’s currency in terms of the currencies of other countries. Fluctuations, the ups and downs, of exchange rates create either gains or losses for global companies. Data about international financial transactions must be translated into the currency of the country where the parent company resides.\n\n\n## Chapter 17\n\n- Financial managers\n    - What is the structure of the finance function at the typical firm?\n        - \u003cimg src=\"https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_managerial-accounting/section_05/16fde2d3f3ada19d2562ba44d7a5a5a5.jpg\" width=\"300\"\u003e\n        - The head of the finance function of a firm usually has the title of *chief financial officer (CFO)* and generally reports directly to the firm’s chief executive officer.\n        - Reporting to the CFO are the **treasurer, the controller, and the vice-president of financial management**.\n    - Explain the risk–return trade-off.\n        - Financial managers try to maximize the wealth of their firm’s shareholders by striking the right **balance between risk and return**. Often, the decisions that involve the highest potential returns expose the firm to the greatest risks.\n- Financial plan\n    - Define financial plan\n        - A *financial plan* is a document that specifies the **funds needed** by a firm for a given period of time, the **timing of cash inflows and outflows**, and the most appropriate **sources and uses of funds**\n    - What three questions does a financial plan address?\n        1. **What** funds will be required **during the planning** period?\n        2. **When** will funds be needed?\n        3. **Where** will funds be obtained?\n    - Explain the steps involved in preparing a financial plan?\n        1. The first step is to forecast sales over a future period of time.\n        2. Second, the financial manager must estimate the expected level of profits over the planning period.\n        3. The final step is to decide on the additional assets needed to support the additional sales.\n- Asset management\n    - Why do firms often choose to invest excess cash in marketable securities?\n        - **Cash** in hand earns **no rate of return**. Excess cash should be invested in **marketable securities**.\n        - Marketable securities are low-risk securities that have short maturity dates and can be easily sold in the secondary markets. As a result, they are easily converted into cash when needed.\n    - What are the two aspects of accounts receivable management?\n        - The two aspects of accounts receivable management are deciding on an *overall credit policy* (whether to offer credit and, if so, what terms of credit to offer) and deciding *which customers will be offered credit*.\n    - Explain the difference between an expansion decision and a replacement decision?\n        - An *expansion decision* involves decisions about offering **new products** or building or acquiring **new production facilities**.\n        - A *replacement decision* considers whether to **replace an existing asset** with a new asset.\n- Funds and capital structure\n    -  Explain the concept of leverage.\n        - *Leverage* is a technique of **increasing the rate of return** by **borrowing funds**.

In addition, short-term funds can sometimes be difficult to obtain.\n    - What is an important factor in deciding on a firm’s dividend policy?\n        - The main factor in deciding on a firm’s dividend policy is its **investment opportunities**. Firms with more profitable investment opportunities often pay less in dividends than firms that have fewer such opportunities.\n- Short-term financing options\n    - What are the three sources of short-term funding?\n        1.

These companies invest in a variety of financial and real assets, such as real estate. Although most investments are based on the best risk–return trade-off, investment decisions are also influenced by political, social, and strategic considerations\n- Mergers, acquisitions, buyouts, and divestitures.\n    - Define synergy.\n        - *Synergy* is the term used to describe the **benefits produced by a merger or acquisition**. It refers to the idea that the combined firm is worth more than the buyer firm and the target firm are worth individually.\n    - What is an LBO?\n        - An *LBO* (*leveraged buyout*) occurs when **public shareholders are bought out and the firm reverts to private status**. LBOs are usually financed with large amounts of borrowed money.\n    - What are the two types of divestitures?\n        - In a *selloff*, **assets are sold by one firm to another firm**.\n        - In a *spinoff*, a **new firm is created from the assets divested**.

According to the *statistical view*, abnormal behaviour can be determined by how frequently it occurs in the population.\n    - *Personal distress* can indicate the presence of abnormal behaviour\n    - The *personal dysfunction* viewpoint emphasizes that abnormal behaviour interferes with appropriate functioning in a particular situation or environment.\n    - Abnormal behaviour could be defined in terms of whether it violates *societal norms* and values.\n    - Experts may determine what qualifies as abnormal behaviour.\n    - None of these principles is necessary or sufficient in defining abnormal behaviour; therefore, our definition of psychological disorders includes elements of all these principles.\n- Understand how the conceptualization of psychological disorders **changed from antiquity to the 1800s**.\n    - Evidence from *prehistoric* times suggests that supernatural explanations for psychological disorders may have been dominant.\n    - *Greek and Roman* philosophers and physicians held surprisingly modern views and emphasized biological and psychological causes and treatments of disorders.\n    - In the *Arab* world, treatment was humane and environmental and psychological factors were emphasized.\n    - During the *Middle Ages* in Europe, attributing supernatural causes to psychological disorders became more common again, although some individuals continued to explore other potential causes. Asylums were established around the 1500s, but treatment was often harsh and ineffective.\n    - During the *Enlightenment*, social and psychological factors became increasingly emphasized and treatments became more humane, although resources for caring for the mentally ill were still scarce.\n    - Abnormal behaviour may be caused by *medical problems* such as syphilis. These problems are normally treated pharmacologically and potential medical causes are often ruled out before diagnosing a mental disorder.\n- Describe at least two **treatments** that are associated with the biological approach and outline the current status of these treatments.\n    - *Surgical* procedures such as lobotomies were used to remove areas of the brain that were implicated in mental disorders.\n    - *Electroconvulsive therapy* employs electricity in order to induce a seizure in patients. This treatment has become much safer over the years and is still used for severe depression.\n    - *Pharmacological* treatments for psychological disorders usually target neurotransmitters and are currently a popular treatment method.\n- Describe the contributions of at least two influential Canadian individuals in the field of mental health care.\n    - Dr. **Ruth Kajander** was one of the first psychiatrists to use major tranquilizers to treat schizophrenia.\n    - **Albert Bandura** developed a theory of learning of aggressive behaviour in childhood and generated a number of treatment approaches emphasizing learning theory.\n    - **Donald Meichenbaum** played a key role in the development of cognitive-behavioural therapy, which is now used as a treatment for a variety of psychological disorders.\n- Describe two recent significant developments associated with mental health in Canada and discuss implications of recent technological advances on the field of psychology.\n    - The Mental Health Commission of Canada was established to improve access to mental health care and to reduce the stigma of mental illness.

When anxiety occurs, we might expect to see increased heart rate and breathing (physiology). The individual may also experience thoughts such as “Something terrible will happen” (cognition), and avoid the anxiety-provoking trigger (behaviour). Anxiety is distinct from panic and fear. Although these are all emotional states, in anxiety the individual feels threatened by a potential future event. In fear, the individual responds to a present or perceived threat. Panic is similar to fear but, in contrast to fear, which is often in response to an objective threat, panic is extreme and can be triggered in the absence of an actual threat.\n    - This chapter highlighted descriptions of the major anxiety disorders listed in DSM-5: panic disorder with and without agoraphobia, specific phobia, social anxiety disorder, GAD, OCD, BDD, and PTSD.\n- Discuss various etiological factors involved in anxiety and related disorders.\n    - Three main etiological factors are known to be involved in anxiety disorders: biological, psychological, and interpersonal. Biological factors encompass genetic heritability and the role of brain systems, including the amygdala and neurochemicals such as GABA. Learning (a psychological factor) and attachment influences (interpersonal factors) are also contributing factors.\n    - Etiological models of anxiety disorders include the two-factor theory, the equipotientiality premise, and the nonassociative model. Concepts important to understanding anxiety disorders include panic attacks, compulsions, and obsessions.\n- Identify and describe the methods involved in the assessment of anxiety and related disorders. Differentiate the anxiety and anxiety-related disorders from one another.\n    - Methods of assessment include the use of structured and semi-structured interviews to establish if the individual meets diagnostic criteria for a particular disorder. Behavioural and psychophysiological indices are sometimes used to measure severity and to determine how the disorder is manifested. For example, the clinician could measure heart and breathing rates in an individual who describes having panic attacks or behavioural avoidance in an individual with social phobia. Self-report measures are also an invaluable part of assessment. These reports can measure each individual’s self-reported behaviour, symptoms, and emotions.\n- Summarize and discuss common treatments for anxiety and related disorders.\n    - Interventions include pharmacotherapy, cognitive restructuring, exposure techniques, problem solving, relaxation, and other techniques such as exercise and mindfulness strategies.\n\n\n# Lecture\n\n\u003e [[Anxiety]] `-\u003e` [[Fear]] `-\u003e` Panic (a “false alarm” that is triggered in the absence of a concrete, identifiable threat)\n\n- `PDF`:\n    - [[Class10.pdf]]\n- What are the 3 factors of emotion?\n    - Subjective experience (focused on therapy)\n    - Physiological response\n    - Behavioural response\n- [[Separation Anxiety Disorder]]\n    - ==Symptoms==: What are the major symptoms of SAD?

Describe the symptoms and clinical features of the major unipolar and bipolar mood disorders.\n    - Depressive disorders involve a change in mood to depression, and include major depressive disorder (MDD) and dysthymia.\n    - Symptoms of MDD include persistent feelings of sadness, loss of interest in activities, loss of appetite or weight loss, insomnia, low energy, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, difficulty concentrating or making decisions, and suicidality. At least five of these symptoms must be present for at least two weeks, although episodes of MDD typically last for several months.\n    - Symptoms of persistent depression are chronic feelings of sadness that persist for at least two years, plus at least an additional two depressive symptoms.\n    - Bipolar disorders involve alternating periods of depression and mania, and include bipolar I disorder (mania alternating with episodes of major depression), bipolar II disorder (hypomania alternating with episodes of major depression), and cyclothymia (hypomania alternating with minor episodes of depression).\n2. Explain how biological, psychological, and environmental factors can work together to cause mood disorders.\n    - Mood disorders are caused by the interaction of psychological, environmental, and biological variables.\n    - Early psychodynamic views of depression saw it as stemming from an unresolved regression to the oral stage of development following a real or imagined loss. More recent psychodynamic theories have focused on disruptions of early parent–child attachment and the development of pathological adult relationships.\n    - Cognitive models stress the role of negative thinking patterns that derive from rigid and tightly connected negative schemas about the self, world, and future.\n    - Interpersonal models point to specific maladaptive behaviour patterns that depression-prone individuals engage in, ones that heighten risk for interpersonal conflicts and rejections to trigger depression.\n    - Life stress models propose that depression occurs when a stressful event in the environment triggers an underlying biological or psychological diathesis.\n    - Biological models of the mood disorders have focused on the role of genetics, neurochemistry, and brain function and structure. Both major depression and bipolar disorder have a strong genetic component, and this may be mediated at least in part by the role of the serotonin transporter gene in heightening sensitivity to stressful life events. Mood disorders are also associated with disruptions in serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine neurotransmission. Techniques that look at the function and structure of the brain have found decreased blood flow in certain cortical regions of the brain, as well as increased activity in limbic areas, such as the amygdala, when processing negative information.\n3. Identify the major classes of medications used to treat unipolar and bipolar mood disorders.\n    - Biological treatments for major depression involve medications (monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclics, and serotonin reuptake inhibitors) that increase the availability of one or more neurotransmitters. Other biological treatments include electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), transmagnetic stimulation (TMS), vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), and deep brain stimulation (DBS). All of these more invasive techniques have shown promise for severely and chronically depressed patients who do not respond to psychotherapy or medication.\n    - Biological treatments for bipolar disorder include lithium, anticonvulsant medication, or antipsychotic medication.\n4. Define cognitive-behavioural therapy and describe its basic techniques in treating major depressive disorder.\n    - Psychological treatments for major depression include cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) and interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT). These emphasize the role of negative thinking patterns and improving interpersonal relationships and functioning through structured, collaborative, and time-limited therapy sessions.\n5. Compare and contrast the three forms of adjunctive psychotherapies for bipolar disorder.\n    - Adjunctive psychological treatments have recently been developed to help improve remission rates and prevent relapse in bipolar disorder. These include family-focused therapy (FFT), interpersonal and social rhythm therapy (IPSRT), and cognitive therapy (CT).\n6. Explain how biological, psychological, and social factors can all contribute to suicide\n    - Suicide is a devastating problem with huge economic and human costs, and it is now the second-leading cause of death in young people. Men in all age groups are over three times more likely than women to complete suicide, while women are three times more likely than men to attempt suicide. Suicide rates also differ across age categories, with males aged 19 to 24 and over 70 being at greatest risk. Indigenous communities in Canada have suicide rates two to four times greater than in the rest of the country.\n    - Suicide is caused by a variety of social, psychological, and biological variables, including genetic predisposition and low serotonin neurotransmission, a sense of detachment from society, and severe stress.\n    - Broad primary prevention strategies have not been effective in reducing suicide rates, although strategies that focus on reducing access to lethal means have shown more promise. Treatment of suicide depends on the severity of the behaviour and can range from inpatient hospitalization to outpatient medication and/or psychotherapy.\n\n\n# Lecture\n\n- [[Major Depressive Disorder]]\n    - Prevalence\n        - $5\\%$ of all population\n        - **Mid-twenties** as typical onset age\n        - **$50\\%$ also have [[Anxiety Disorders]]**\n    - What is the basic ==Diagnostic== criteria in DSM\n        - **$\u003e5/9$ [[Major Depressive Disorder#DSM Diagnostic Criteria|symptom]]**, at least one from 2 of the ★ symptoms within **2-week** period\n            1. **Depressive mood** (self-reported or observed or irritation for teen)\n            2. **Anhedonia**\n            3.

poor coordination; and deficient attention, perception, and learning are characteristic of most people with schizophrenia.\n    - Abnormalities of the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain are among the most studied features of schizophrenia, but no single brain abnormality occurs in everyone with the disorder.\n    - Neuroscience research methods provide increasingly accurate and sophisticated information about the structure and physiology of the brain.\n    - The most frequently implicated neurochemical abnormality in schizophrenia involves the neurotransmitter dopamine.\n- Identify and explain the effectiveness of antipsychotic medication and psychosocial therapies in the treatment of schizophrenia\n    - Chlorpromazine was the first effective antipsychotic medication used with schizophrenia patients, reducing the severity of positive and, to a lesser degree, negative symptoms.\n    - Newer generations of antipsychotic medications claim to provide therapeutic benefits with fewer side effects.\n    - Antipsychotic medications have little or no effect on the cognitive impairments associated with schizophrenia.\n    - Significant advances have been made in the application of psychological interventions, such as cognitivebehaviour therapy (CBT), family therapy, and cognitive remediation training.\n    - Cognitive remediation training has potential value for addressing cognitive impairment and may also reduce some symptoms and improve social functioning in people with schizophrenia.\n    - Early intervention, whereby medication and psychological therapies are provided before a person develops prolonged psychosis, has become a new and promising focus for clinical researchers.\n    - Integrated psychosocial and medical therapies offer the most hope for improving the lives of people with schizophrenia.\n\n# Lecture\n\n- Prevalence and related facts\n    - $1\\%$ of general population\n    - Typical onset is 15-45\n    - `Female = Male`\n- What is heterogeneity and how does it relate to [[Schizophrenia]]\n    - *Heterogeneity*: a tendency for people with the disorder to differ from each other in symptoms, family and personal background, response to treatment, and ability to live outside of hospital\n    - Makes diagnostic difficult and causes stigma\n- ==Diagnostic== criteria for [[Schizophrenia]]\n    - **$\u003e2$**, and $\u003e1$ ★ for a significant portion of time during 1-month\n        1. ★ [[Psychotic Disorder#Delusions|Delusion]]: false perceptions (thoughts)\n            - Persecutory (conspiracy)\n            - Referential (taking personally)\n            - Somatic (about body)\n            - Religious (demons)\n            - Grandiose (special powers)\n        2. ★ [[Psychotic Disorder#Hallucinations|Hallucination]]: misinterpretation of sensory perception\n            - Hearing voices\n        3. ★ Disorganized speech\n            - Nonsensical speech often signals the presence of thought disorder\n            - [[Schizophrenia#^7a9a5a|Loosening of associations]]\n        4.

Furthermore, accurate assessment and diagnosis, as well as effective treatment of mental disorders, rely on a system of classification. Diagnostic systems are also needed for surveying population health and for understanding the prevalence and etiology of particular mental health problems.\n- Outline what criteria can be used to evaluate a system of classification.\n    - Every science includes a system for categorizing information. In abnormal psychology, the perfect diagnostic system would be based on etiology, presenting symptoms, prognosis, and response to treatment. This diagnostic system would also enhance the organization of clinical factors and provide a shorthand to help professionals communicate easily.\n- Describe the history of classification of mental disorders.\n    - Although attempts to classify mental disorders date back to at least the Middle Ages, modern efforts at classification owe much to Kraepelin’s work in the nineteenth century. A milestone in the modern development of a comprehensive diagnostic scheme was the World Health Organization’s decision to add mental health disorders to the International List of the Causes of Death. In 1948 the list was expanded to become the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Injuries, and Causes of Death (ICD), a comprehensive listing of all diseases, including abnormal behaviour. In response to limitations of the ICD system, the American Psychiatric Association published its own classification system, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM), in 1952. Both of these systems of classification (ICD and DSM) have undergone numerous revisions, in efforts to address inadequacies of previous editions (e.g., poor reliability) and to ensure that research evidence informs 62 our classification of mental disorders. Currently, the system of classification used most commonly in North America is the DSM-5.\n- Describe the system of classification of mental disorders.\n    - The editions of the DSM have progressed considerably in arriving at DSM-5 and recognize the importance of psychosocial features in the development and maintenance of psychological problems.\n- Identify the key reasons why the system of classification was revised to create the DSM-5.\n    - To address some of the limitations of the diagnostic system, the DSM is periodically revised. The guiding principles behind the revisions are to update the diagnostic system, based on the most current available scientific evidence, and to enhance the clinical utility of the diagnostic system.\n- Describe the benefits of going beyond the DSM by using a new classification framework for research that examines psychopathology.\n    - Many professionals feel that current and past versions of the DSM remain too closely aligned with the medical model, and that this leads to excessive stigmatization and loss of information about individuals. The whole enterprise of diagnosis of mental disorders is also criticized for using categories that do not do justice to the complexity of human behaviour and for displaying gender and cultural biases.\n- Outline the major criticisms of the current and past systems of classification of mental disorders.\n    - As we have seen, the DSM-5 is far from perfect. However, as the history of classification in the natural sciences has demonstrated, the development of a diagnostic classification system is an ongoing process that requires continual refinement. Classification is an accepted procedure in all sciences, and it is very likely that the field of mental health will continue to use it. It is encouraging to note that the field of mental health is continually looking to efforts to improve and validate the diagnostic system using empirical evidence. This scientific attitude should allow the detection of flaws in the present system and lead to an improved diagnostic system in the future. An example of this is the NIMH’s adoption of RDoC as a way of encouraging researchers to examine underlying processes across domains of functioning and at various levels of analysis to better understand psychopathology, and eventually, to develop a more biologically valid classification system and better treatments. Gradually, diagnostic categories in any mental health taxonomy should be refined as we fill in the present gaps in our knowledge and come to recognize how culture, politics, and social norms have influenced professional concepts of mental health. This refinement process is well under way.\n\n# Lecture\n\n- Describe **why** we need a classification system for mental disorders?\n    - A vocabulary for communicating about mental disorders with others\n- Outline what **criteria** of \"perfect\" diagnostic system ^46def1\n    1. **Symptoms** (clusters): symptom mapping to disorder\n    2. **Etiology** (cause): history leading to disorder\n    3. **Prognosis** (natural course): phases\n    4.

Psychometrically strong (i.e., reliable and valid) psychological tests contribute to a well-rounded psychological assessment. Psychological assessment plays an important role in abnormal psychology, providing a comprehensive system for describing an individual’s psychological profile. A psychological test provides a piece of information that must be integrated and evaluated within the context of other information to create a thorough psychological assessment\n- Explain the importance of reliability and validity in clinical assessment.\n    - Reliability and validity are important for both research and clinical assessment. Having measurement tools that are reliable and valid helps ensure that clinicians can consistently measure what they are hoping to, and are measuring what they think they are measuring.\n- Describe the strengths and weaknesses of clinical versus actuarial prediction\n    - The debate between clinical and actuarial prediction has continued for years. It involves the contrast between clinicians’ professional experience and intuition versus statistical procedures and empirical methods in clinical decision making. Both clinical and actuarial prediction have benefits and limitations\n    - Biogically based procedures used in the study of psychological problems include EEG, CT scan, MRI, and PET. Although the results of most brain imaging assessments cannot be used to help in diagnoses, aside from circumstances in which there is obvious neurological impairment, they have contributed greatly to research.\n    - A number of neuropsychological tests are used to study brain–behaviour relationships, including the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Halstead Reitan Neuropsychological Test Battery, the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status, and the Bender Visual-Motor Gestalt Test.\n    - Clinical interviews have always been an integral part of any psychological assessment, and more structured components have been recently developed to reduce bias\n    - IQ tests were the first psychological tests to gain wide acceptance, and they do a fairly good job of predicting school performance. IQ tests with good psychometric properties also readily distinguish between individuals who are intellectually gifted, individuals who have learning disabilities, and individuals with intellectual disabilities\n    - Projective tests, initially based on psychoanalytic theory, were the first personality tests. The Rorschach inkblot test and Thematic Apperception Test are two examples of projective tests. However, actuarial personality tests like the MMPI-2, MCMI-IV, and PAI, based on more psychometrically sound procedures, have become more favoured among clinicians. Behavioural and cognitivebehavioural assessment techniques have become widely accepted. Most of these tests focus on specific behaviour problems (e.g., risk of suicide, level of depression, ability to concentrate) rather than on the whole range of personality functioning.\n- Compare and contrast structured versus unstructured interviews and describe circumstances in which you might favour one format over the other\n    - Both structured and unstructured interviews have advantages and disadvantages. Semi-structured interviews provide a nice balance between facilitating rapport with clients while affording standardization and reliability.\n- Define what an “experiment” is and explain what differentiates it from non-experimental research methods\n    - The controlled experiment is not always possible in human research for ethical and logistical reasons. However, quasi-experimental and correlational research can provide a great deal of insight into human behaviour. Although not as scientifically rigorous, case studies and single-subject research designs can raise important questions and may point the way to more controlled research. Family, adoption, twin, and gene–environment interaction studies offer valuable insight into the relative contribution of heredity and the environment. Experiments differ from these other forms of non-experimental research in that they manipulate variables, randomly assign participants to experimental and control groups, and can draw clear inferences about cause and effect\n- Explain why it is important to consider clinical significance in addition to statistical significance\n    - Recently, researchers have stressed that it is not enough to simply demonstrate statistically significant results of an intervention. The more important question is whether the treatment offers meaningful relief of the distress or difficulty of people with psychopathology. Research now recognizes the importance of examining both statistical and clinical significance when determining if a treatment is effective and will be useful in the real world.\n\n\n\n# Lecture\n\n- `PDF`\n    - ![[Class5.pdf]]\n- ==Assessment==:  What leads to a good diagnosis in psychology\n    - Good Testing `-\u003e` Good Assessment `-\u003e` Good diagnosis\n    - *Psychological assessment*, a systematic gathering and evaluation of information for target individual\n        - History, referral information, behavioural observations, and life of an individual\n    - *Psychological test* provides a **sample** of information that must be integrated and evaluated **within the context**\n- ==Assessment==: What are the 4 measures of [[Reliability]] and [[Validity]], and how do they differ?\n    - [[Reliability]]\n        1.

Alternate-form reliability\n            - Two versions of the same test are designed and scores from each are correlated with one another\n        3. Internal consistency\n            - The degree of reliability within a test; one measure is split-half reliability, which compares responses on odd numbers to responses on even numbers\n        4. Coefficient alpha\n            - Calculated by **averaging the intercorrelations** of all items within a test\n    - [[Validity]]\n        1. Face validity\n            - Means that the items on a test **resemble** the characteristics of the concept being measured\n        2. Content validity\n            - Requires that the test’s items reflect **all** behaviours believed to be related to the overall construct\n        3. Criterion validity\n            - Rises because some qualities are easier to **recognize** than to define completely\n        4.

In some disorders, the cause is clearly genetic (e.g., chromosomal abnormality). Intellectual disabilities can also be caused by environmental factors at different stages of development (e.g., maternal malnutrition, toxins, or maternal infections; oxygen deprivation; prematurity; or birth-related trauma). The postnatal environment can also significantly affect development. Intervention strategies for people with intellectual disabilities tend to focus on developing social and community living skills and reducing or managing challenging behaviours. Pharmaceutical interventions for severe behavioural problems and mental health difficulties associated with dual diagnosis are recommended. Sex education, while controversial, can increase sexuality awareness and reduce the risk of abuse while promoting more successful integration into the community. Genetic and supportive counselling for family members and parent training can reduce family stress and improve quality of life for individuals with developmental disorders and their families.\n\n# Lecture\n\n- `PDF`:\n    - ![[Class6.pdf]]\n- ==Prevalence== What is the prevalence rate of [[Intellectual disability]]?\n    - Vary to $1\\% - 3\\%$ depending on classification system\n- ==Symptom== What are some (4) common [[Intellectual disability#Symptoms|symptoms]] of intellectual disability?\n- ==Diagnosis==: What are the 3 criteria that must be met for a [[Intellectual disability#^8c02df|diagnosis]]\n    - `Adaptive + IQ Test + Developmetal Period`:\n    - How is **Intelligence** [[IQ Test#^995568|measured]] (5 criteria)\n    - [[IQ Test#Scales|Tests]] with 4 level of categorization\n    - What are some issues with IQ measurement\n        - Also reflect adaptive behaviour (not single targeted measurement)\n        - Description of functioning level should be *contextualized*\n        - Do not take into account sensory, motor, or language deficits\n        - Individuals with intellectual disabilities typically have not received the type of exposure to test environments that other individuals have\n    - What is adaptive behaviour and how it is been measured\n        - *Adaptive behaviour*: encompasses conceptual, social, and practical abilities, including areas of [[communication]]; self-care; domestic, academic, social, or community leisure and work skills\n        - **Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales** Third Edition 2006\n        - **Evaluates** the level of support needed\n        - Adaptive Behavior Assessment System Third Edition\n        - Scales of Independent Behavior-Revised\n    - What are some interviewing issues related to diagnosis\n        - Relatively good function `-\u003e` Hide aspects of disorder\n        - Cognitive and linguistic limitations, and social desirability may give way to acquiescence during an interview\n        - Interviewing family members provides an additional perspective (potential bias)\n- ==Etiology==: Zigler's Two-Group Appraoch\n    - Organic group: a clear **biological basis** (severe and profound ID)\n        - [[#^edc6d1|Genetic disorders]]\n        - Chromosome abnormalities\n            - *Chromosomal Abnormalities*: result of a structural alteration in the chromosome or due to a person having a greater or smaller number of chromosomes\n            - Parental Screening\n                - Chorionic villus sampling (CVS): obtaining cells from the placenta; complication about $2-5\\%$\n                - Amniocentesis: A small amount of amniotic fluid is withdrawn, and cells contained in the fluid are then cultured in the lab; accuracy $99.4\\%$; complication about $0.5\\%$\n            - [[Down syndrome]] Type 1: trisomy 21 ($95\\%$)\n                - Children: delayed nonverbal cognitive development, deficits in verbal abilities and auditory short-term memory\n        - Behavioural phenotypes\n            - *Behavioural phenotypes*: the pattern of social, cognitive, and behavioural abnormalities\n            - [[#^eaffba|Environmental Factor]]\n    - Cultural-familial group: no clear organic basis (mild ID)\n        - Poverty: They are found more frequently within lower socio-economic groups, and commonly have at least one parent and possibly one or more siblings with developmental delays\n- ==Etiology== Genetic Based (Organic) ^edc6d1\n    - $14\\%$ of developmental disabilities has a genetic basis\n    - What are the 3 types of genetic inheritance\n        - Has $50\\%$ of inheriting\n        - *Dominant inheritance*: only 1 parent has it can pass on\n            - Ex.

Explain varying prevalence rates for **autism spectrum disorders**\n    - The deinstitutionalization and mainstreaming movements have emphasized the importance of community integration. However they have also highlighted the potential risks of vulnerability and exploitation in community inclusion. Evaluation of community-based care and quality of life has become an important area of work for psychologists\n    - Systematic intensive early intervention programs applying operant conditioning principles have been found effective in developing language and social skills and in managing challenging behaviour. A specific learning disorder according to DMS-5 includes four essential diagnostic features: persistent difficulties learning and using key academic skills despite the provision of interventions that target those difficulties; performance of academic skills that are well below average for chronological age; appearance of the learning difficulties in the school years; and a recognition that learning difficulties are not attributable to other neurological conditions or intellectual disabilities.\n- Explain the cognitive impairments that are the defining features of specific **learning disorders**\n    - **Autism spectrum disorder** is characterized by deficits in the areas of social [[communication]] and behavioural interests exhibited by a lack of social responsiveness or reciprocity, unusual sensory responses to the environment, absent or unusual expressive language and restrictive or repetitive behaviours.

Individuals with learning disorders experience specific impairments in one or more of the cognitive processes related to learning\n        - Cognitive processes include phonological processing, working memory, processing speed, language processing, visual-spatial processing, executive functions, and visualmotor processing.\n        - Learning disorders can impede academic achievement in the areas of reading, writing, or mathematics. They can also impact daily life, such as having difficulty with problem solving, organization, following multi-step instructions, or, sometimes, understanding sarcasm\n    - Persons with **learning disabilities** are two to three times more likely to experience mental health challenges, including anxiety, and difficulties with social competence\n        - Early identification by means of a comprehensive psychological assessment, academic remediation and accommodations in the school setting, and support or therapeutic intervention where appropriate, is vital for enabling individuals with LD to accomplish goals and to engage in fulfilling and productive lives\n\n# Lecture\n\n- `PDF`:\n    - ![[Class7.pdf]]\n- [[Autism spectrum disorder]]\n    - Discovered by 1943, Leo Kanner, described as innate as a  [[genetic disorder]]\n    - ==Symptoms==: What are the 3 most important symptoms in [[communication]]?\n        1.

Teachers have been shown to be better respondents than parents about severity of ADHD and social functioning. Parents have been shown to be the most comprehensive respondents about disruptive behaviour, although they under-report conduct symptoms compared to the child. Adolescents are the most accurate respondents with respect to anxiety.\n        - These developmental and informant factors specific to children and youth emphasize the importance of comprehensive assessment of symptoms and global functioning from multiple informants in this population.\n        - Regardless of the type of disorder, all diagnoses require that the child show evidence of persistent impairment in multiple settings, which can be directly attributed to the symptoms of disorder.\n- Describe the prevalence of common childhood mental disorders (ADHD, disruptive behaviour disorders, and anxiety disorders) and their comorbidities.\n    - **One in five youth have a psychiatric disorder**. Forty percent of these youth have multiple disorders (comorbidity). Having a childhood disorder substantially increases the risk for developing another disorder (heterotypic continuity) or continuing to have the same disorder (homotypic continuity).\n    - Some disorders appear to be more common in boys prior to puberty (ADHD) and in girls following puberty (anxiety disorders and mood disorders). Although conduct disorders are more common in boys before puberty, the rates are more similar across sex in adolescence.\n    - ADHD can be diagnosed in 2% of preschoolers and 6% of children and adolescents. ADHD is 10 times as prevalent in clinical samples. The prevalence of ODD (3 to 6%) and CD (1 to 10%) is similar to ADHD, although more difficult to estimate as many studies do not clearly distinguish the prevalence of ODD from CD (and many do not account for the comorbid condition ADHD). Anxiety disorders are also common, but rates vary by disorder, with the most common presentation being separation anxiety disorder (5% of children) and the least common being social anxiety disorder (1% of children).\n- Identify the symptoms and clinical features of common childhood mental disorders.\n    - ADHD\n        - ADHD is a neuropsychiatric disorder that reflects problems with executive functions, such as the regulation of attention, behaviour, and motivation. The two broad areas of symptom impairment are hyperactivity/ impulsivity and inattention. The DSM recognizes ADHD subtypes (now called specifiers) where some children appear more hyperactive or more inattentive and can be classified as such, although most children with ADHD have both hyperactivity/impulsivity and inattention.\n    - ODD \u0026 CD\n        - ODD and CD describe youth who have persistent difficulties of reacting negatively toward others with hostility or defiance as a primary problem (ODD) or engaging in behaviour that result in deliberate physical or emotional harm to others (CD). It is clear that these diagnoses describe the behaviour of the youth and not so much their underlying difficulties, such as comorbid disorders (ADHD, anxiety, or learning disabilities) or the difficult social circumstances they live in. For example, recent research suggests there may be a subgroup of ODD youth who struggle with high levels of irritable mood, and a group of CD youth who have psychopathic tendencies.\n    - Anxiety Disorders\n        - Children with anxiety disorders experience all of the following difficulties: mental preoccupations with worries or fears, behavioural or mental actions directed toward avoidance of the perceived source of fear or worry, and physical distress (headaches, tension) because of the worry. What differs across the types of anxiety disorders is the focus of the fear or worry. For example, being worried about a parent’s safety is consistent with separation anxiety, being worried about potential embarrassment is consistent with social anxiety, and being worried about unpredictable events is consistent with generalized anxiety.\n- Explain how biological, psychological, and environmental factors can work together to increase the risk of developing these common childhood mental disorders.\n    - Mental disorders present as a result of multiple risk processes that involve components of disturbed biology, environment, and psychological factors. The timing of occurrence of disorder and the severity of the disorder are related to the ways these factors exert their effects for a particular child. It is therefore false to assume that any one factor is causal. When describing a mental disorder and its presentation, it is important to consider how biological, environmental, and psychological factors are of relevance for that child. For example, most children with ADHD have a family history, attesting to its inherited genetic component, and their symptoms typically respond to stimulant medication, suggesting a biological basis for the disorder. Symptoms of ADHD are worse in unstructured environments (such as lunchtime versus in class), attesting to the influence of context in shaping behaviour. Many children with ADHD are difficult to parent or teach and experience difficulties with peers, and their self-esteem is often affected. It is important to intervene in all these areas to help the child with ADHD.\n    - Environmental\n        - More so than adults, children and youth are influenced by their environments and the lives of others around them because they have less autonomy for their decisions. This reality can also influence the presentation of impairment or symptoms.\n        - It is important to consider the impact of life stressors and family context on a child’s symptoms. The impact of treatment or cognitive and emotional development on symptom persistence is also important to consider as children continue to grow and mature.\n    - Risks\n        - New research suggests that sources of “risk” are not as clear-cut as previously assumed. Specifically, differential susceptibility theory and biological sensitivity to context theory suggest that sources of vulnerability can not only increase the risk of poorer outcomes, but they can also be associated with more positive outcomes in the context of more supportive environments.\n        - Perfectionism is characterized by self-imposed high standards that are hard to achieve. Perfectionism is common among youth, affecting close to one in five teens. Given perfectionism’s strong relation to depression, it is generally suggested that the targeting perfectionism should be a treatment goal when dealing with depressed clients.\n- Identify evidence-based psychological and pharmacological treatments for common childhood mental disorders.\n    - ADHD\n        - ADHD: Evidence-based psychological interventions should be provided to all families who have a child with ADHD. These include caregiver psychoeducation, parent-training programs to help parents facilitate more functional behaviour patterns, and school-focused interventions, including psychoeducational testing for learning difficulties and providing classroom modifications to facilitate attention. Pharmacological treatments for ADHD include short- and long-acting derivatives of methylphenidate, dextroamphetamine, and amphetamine. These compounds work by increasing the sensitivity of dopamine receptors in the prefrontal cortex. Children treated with these medications require close medical monitoring. These treatments do not cure ADHD but help reduce symptoms and should be used in concert with psychological interventions.\n    - ODD \u0026 CD\n        - ODD and CD: Four diverse treatment methods have been shown to be helpful for ODD and CD: (1) teaching problem-solving skills, (2) pharmacological interventions, (3) parent management training, and (4) schooland community-based treatments. With the exception of pharmacological interventions, these methods help to break the coercive effect of the youth’s behaviour on families and peers by teaching others how to respond to the behaviour or increasing the youth’s sensitivity to the effects of his or her behaviour on others. Pharmacological interventions are generally focused on the treatment of comorbid conditions (ADHD or anxiety).\n    - Anxiety\n        - Anxiety disorders: Cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) has been shown to be effective for the treatment of childhood anxiety disorders. CBT should include a parent component as many parents have anxiety themselves or reinforce the child’s avoidance behaviour. Medications for treatment of anxiety in children and youth include antidepressant medications (serotonin specific reuptake inhibitors), and are used as an adjunct to CBT or as a means of reducing anxiety sufficiently to allow participation in CBT.\n    - Mood\n        - Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is classified as a mood disorder in the DSM-5 but it represents a perfect intersect between externalizing and internalizing problems. If a child’s symptoms meet diagnostic criteria for both DMDD and ODD, the diagnosis of DMDD is given.\n\n\n# Lecture\n\n- `PDF`:\n    - ![[Class8.pdf]]\n- Externalizing vs. Internalizing\n    - *Externalizing problems*: disorders of undercontrolled behaviour\n        - [[Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder]] (ADHD), oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), and [[Conduct Disorder]] (CD);\n    - *Internalizing problems*: disorders of overcontrolled behaviour\n        - Separation anxiety disorder (SAD), selective mutism, reactive attachment disorder (RAD), [[Anxiety Disorders]], mood disorders, including Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD)\n    - Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder represents a perfect intersect between externalizing and internalizing problems\n- Externalizing: [[Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder|ADHD]]\n    - $2/3$ of the children with ADHD lose diagnosis into adulthood\n    - ==Symptoms==: What are the 3 common symptoms of ADHD?\n        - Motorically and often verbally hyperactive\n        - Have problems maintaining their focus in conversations and activities\n        - They show impulsive or erratic behaviour\n    - ==Diagnostic==: What are the 3 types of ADHD and their (3) common symptoms?\n        - Listed in the [[Neurodevelopmental Disorders]] section\n            - [[Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder#Diagnosis|DSM-5 Criteria]]\n        - (ADHD-I):\n            - ADHD predominantly **inattentive** presentation\n            - More common in girls than in boys\n            1.

In operant conditioning, () signal whether a particular response will lead to a particular outcome.[^1]\n2. () refers to actions or behaviors that benefit another individual at the expense of some cost to the actor. Some such actions may reflect (), or “tit-for-tat” behavior, in which one friend helps another with the expectation that the friend will reciprocate later on.[^2]\n3. The () is a part of the brain that helps determine subjective values of punishers, such as whether the intense heat of a chili pepper on the tongue is perceived as pleasurable or painful. The () is a part of the brain that helps determine the motivational value of punishment—that is, what we do about it.[^3]\n4. () refers to a strong habit that is maintained despite harmful consequences; if the habit is a behavior, it is called a(n) ().[^4]\n5. The part of the brain called the () contains dopamine-producing neurons that project to the () which is important for stimulus–response learning. A different area called the () contains dopamine-producing neurons that project to the frontal cortex and other brain areas.[^5]\n6. The () theory states that learning is driven by an organism’s biological need to reduce innate drives to obtain primary reinforcers.[^6]\n7. In operant conditioning procedures, () is the process of providing outcomes for a behavior that increase the probability of that behavior occurring again in the future, whereas () is the process of providing outcomes that decrease the probability.[^7]\n8. () is the study of how organisms allocate their time and resources among possible options.[^8]\n9. In the operant conditioning technique known as (), successive approximations to a desired response are reinforced. In the operant conditioning technique known as (), organisms are gradually trained to execute complicated sequences of discrete responses.[^9]\n10. () are stimuli such as food and sleep that can function as reinforcers due to their innate biological value to the organism; if these stimuli are paired with other stimuli that have no biological value, such as money or clicking sounds, those other stimuli can become ()[^10]\n11. In a(n) () schedule, every instance of the response is followed by the consequence; in a(n) () schedule, only some responses are reinforced.[^11]\n12. An area of the prefrontal cortex called the () is important for learning to predict which outcomes follow particular responses.[^12]\n13. If a rat in a Skinner box expects that making a response will result in delivery of sugary water but the rat instead receives only plain water, the phenomenon of () predicts that the rat will respond less than if it had received plain water for its efforts all along.[^13]\n14. () are naturally occurring neurotransmitter-like substances that may help signal hedonic value (“liking”) in the brain.[^14]\n15. In a(n) () reinforcement schedule, an organism has a choice between multiple possible responses that may each lead to different outcomes. The () predicts that the organism will make each response at a rate proportional to how often that response is reinforced relative to the other choices.[^15]\n16. In (), organisms learn to make responses in order to obtain or avoid certain outcomes.[^16]\n17. Training paradigms that can cause responses to become less frequent over time include (), in which an undesirable element is delivered after a response, and 9(), in which a desirable element is taken away after the response.[^17]\n18. Training paradigms that can cause responses to become more frequent over time include (), in which a desirable element is delivered after a response, and (), in which an undesirable element is taken away after the response.[^18]\n19. In a fixed-ratio (FR) schedule of reinforcement, organisms typically give bursts of responding leading up to each reinforcement, followed by a(n) () before the next bout of responding begins.[^19]\n20. () refers to the subjective “goodness” of a stimulus. The amount of work an organism will be willing to do to obtain that stimulus depends on the () of that stimulus.[^20]\n\n\n# Lecture\n\n- What is the difference between [[Classical Conditioning]] and [[Operant Conditioning]]?\n    - Focus on the **outcome**.\n    - If the outcome occurs **regardless** of responding, the paradigm is classical;\n    - If the outcome is **contingent** on a response, the paradigm is operant\n    - | Classical Conditioning             | Operant Conditioning                                         |\n    |------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n    | Environment operates on the animal | Animal operates on the environment                           |\n    | Stimulus evokes Response (`S-\u003eR`)  | Stimulus evokes a response to produce an outcome (`S-\u003eR-\u003eO`) |\n    | Animal learns CS predicts US       | Animal connects context, behaviour, and outcome              |\n    |                                    | Also, operant conditioning is more powerful/flexible         |\n- What does `S -\u003e R -\u003e O` each represent in [[Operant Conditioning]]?\n- What is Skinner's [[Skinner's Box|method]] of testing his theory?\n- What are the 3 major component of [[operant conditioning]]?\n- What are the 2 common strategies used in [[Operant Conditioning#Type of Conditioning]]?\n- What is a [[Operant Conditioning#Reinforcer|reinforcer]]?\n- What is a [[Operant Conditioning#Punishment|punisher]]?\n- What are the 4 [[Operant Conditioning#Schedule|schedules]] in OC, real life example of each.\n- What are some brain parts involved in operant conditioning?\n    - `S -\u003e R` learning: [[Basal Ganglia#Dorsal Stratum]]\n    - `R -\u003e O` prediction: [[Prefrontal Cortex#Orbital PFC]]\n    - Reinforcement: [[Ventral Tegmental Area]]\n        - ==Incentive Salience hypothesis==: dopamine motivates learners to work for reinforcement\n        - ==Reward Prediction hypothesis==: dopamine is involved in predicting future reward\n          - \u003cimg src=\"https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/008vxvgGgy1h7k4poizx5j312j0u0jua.jpg\" width=\"300\"\u003e\n          - Revisiting [[Drive Reduction Theory]]\n              - \u003cimg src=\"https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/008vxvgGgy1h7k4pv7xebj319c0raaeg.jpg\" width=\"300\"\u003e\n  - Punishment: *dorsal anterior cingulate (dACC)* \u0026 *Insula*\n      - Insula: determine **subjective values** of punishers\n      - The **dorsal anterior cingulate (dACC)** might be involved in the **motivational** component of pain/punishment (work harder next time to avoid it)\n\n\n## Questions\n\n\n\n\n[^1]: discriminative stimuli\n[^2]: Premack principle, response deprivation\n[^3]: insula; dACC\n[^4]: pathological addiction, behavioral addiction\n[^5]: SNc (substantia nigra), dorsal striatum, ventrl tegmental area\n[^6]: drive reduction theory\n[^7]: Reinforcement, punishment\n[^8]: behavioural economics\n[^9]: shaping, chaining\n[^10]: primary reinforcer, secondary reinforcer\n[^11]: fixed ratio, variable ratio\n[^12]: Orbitofrontal cortex\n[^13]: negative contrast\n[^14]: dopamine\n[^15]: concurrent, matching law\n[^16]: operant conditioning\n[^17]: positive punishment, negative punishment\n[^18]: positive Reinforcement, negative reinforcement\n[^19]: postreinforcement pause\n[^20]: hedonic value, motivational value\n","lastmodified":"2023-05-10T19:08:03.570968381Z","tags":["Note"]},"/UofT-Notes/PSY260/PSY260-L13":{"title":"PSY260: - L13","content":"\n# Reading\n\n1. The general term for conditions involving severe memory loss is (). More specifically, loss of the ability to form new declarative memories is called (), while the loss of previously acquired information is called ().[^1]\n2. Three ways in which memory can be tested are free recall, which entails (); cued recall, which entails (); and recognition, which entails (). Of the three, () usually produces the best performance.[^2]\n3. The “() effect” refers to the phenomenon that memory is usually best when the cues available at testing are similar to those at encoding; the “() effect” refers to the phenomenon that memory is usually best when information is processed in the same way at encoding and retrieval.[^3]\n4. In the () paradigm, subjects typically show worse memory for items that they have been specifically instructed to forget.[^4]\n5. Newly acquired episodic and semantic memories are particularly vulnerable during the (). However, each time a memory is reactivated or recalled, it may again become vulnerable to modification, a process termed ().[^5]\n6. () occurs in some forms of amnesia when patients, asked to remember past events, respond with highly detailed but false memories.[^6]\n7. () is memory for facts and information about the world (including personal information); () is memory for specific events that occurred at a particular time and place.[^7]\n8. The () is located in the medial temporal lobe of the brain and is connected to subcortical structures such as the () by a fiber bundle called the ().[^8]\n9. A false memory is ()[^9]\n10. Areas of the cerebral cortex involved in processing specific types of information, such as sights and sounds, are called (); other areas of the cortex, called (), process information both within and among sensory modalities.[^10]\n11. The Ribot gradient describes a pattern of memory loss in which () memories are more prone to disruption than are () memories.[^11]\n12. () is a sudden memory loss that does not seem to result from physical causes such as brain injury.[^12]\n13. During periods of (), neurons in the hippocampus “replay” the same activation patterns that they showed during prior learning.[^13]\n14. Therapy involving () is sometimes used to treat severe depression but can severely disrupt newly formed memories.[^14]\n15. Whereas () memory includes information we are aware that we know, () memory can exist without the learner’s awareness.[^15]\n16. Severe and permanent amnesia can be caused by brain damage that includes the () or the ().[^16]\n17. () refers to a disruption of memory due to overlap with the content of other memories. In (), new learning disrupts old (previously stored) information. In (), old learning interferes with the ability to recall newly learned information.[^17]\n18. Feeling-of-knowing and judgment-of-learning phenomena are examples of (), the knowledge of, and ability to think about, our memories.[^18]\n19. Episodic memory and semantic memory are sometimes grouped together in the category (), whereas other types of memory, such as skill memory, that are not always consciously accessible or easy to verbalize are sometimes grouped together in the category ().[^19]\n20. () is a transient or temporary disruption of memory that typically includes both anterograde and retrograde amnesia.[^20]\n21. Standard consolidation theory states that brain structures including () the are required for storage and retrieval of () memories but not of () memories. In contrast, multiple trace theory suggests that ().[^21]\n22.

Many studies suggest that () is dysfunctional in the patients with schizophrenia.[^10]\n11. Most pharmacological treatments for schizophrenia work by altering the transmission of (), a neuromodulator that alters neuron-to-neuron communication.[^11]\n12. Short delays are used in the () task for the purpose of assessing working memory; longer delays are used in the same task for the purpose of studying long-term memory.[^12]\n13. Place-based models of memory are also known as () models of memory because they imply the existence of two or more different places for memories to be stored; similarly, statebased models of memory have been referred to as () models of memory because they imply that there is only one place for memory, although these memories can be in various states.[^13]\n14. The () task consists of a series of names of colors, each printed in a color that is different from the color being named.[^14]\n15.

Emotion involves three distinct but interrelated phenomena namely (), (), (), and that are produced in response to an affecting situation.[^1]\n2. The () theory of emotion states that conscious feelings of emotion occur after the mind senses the physiological responses associated with arousal. The () theory of emotion states that conscious feelings of emotion and bodily responses (physiological responses and overt behaviors) occur simultaneously and independently. The () theory of emotion states that a combination of cognitive appraisal and perception of biological changes together determine our experience of emotion.[^2]\n3. The () is a collection of nerves and structures that control internal organs and glands and help mediate the physiological components of emotion.[^3]\n4. A(n) () is an excessive and irrational fear of an object, a place, or a situation. One type of therapy for conditions of this kind includes (), in which successive approximations of the fear-evoking stimulus are presented while the patient learns to remain relaxed.[^4]\n5. The () response (also known as ()) is a collection of bodily responses, including increased blood flow to the muscles, increased respiration, and depressed digestion and immune functions, that prepare the organism to deal with a threat either by facing it down or by running away.[^5]\n6. The  principle that it is easiest to retrieve memories that match our current mood or emotional state is known as ().[^6]\n7. The () is a brain area critical for learning and expressing emotional responses as well as for mediating the emotional modulation of memory.[^7]\n8. In (), animals learn to make particular responses in order to terminate an aversive stimulus. In (), animals learn to make particular responses in order to prevent exposure to that aversive stimulus.[^8]\n9. When we experience emotions such as fear or anger, the ANS releases () that help mediate the fight-or-flight response. Two examples are () and ().[^9]\n10. () is a psychiatric condition that involves feelings of sadness as well as a general loss of initiative and activity. Some think it reflects a type of conditioning called , in which exposure to an uncontrollable punisher teaches an organism that its responses are ineffective, which in turn reduces the motivation to attempt to escape.[^10]\n11. A memory formed under conditions of extreme emotion and that seems especially vivid and long-lasting is called a(n) ().[^11]\n12. () theories of emotion are based on the central premise that physiological responses to stimuli come first, and they determine or induce emotions.[^12]\n13. The () is a cluster of physiological, motor, and conscious reactions that accompany the emotion of fear. An example of a physiological reaction is (), where a mammal’s hair stands on end, making the animal look bigger and more threatening than it is.[^13]\n14. Any stimulus or event that causes bodily arousal is a form of ().[^14]\n15. () is a psychological disorder that can develop after exposure to a horrific event, with symptoms including (), (), (), and ().[^15]\n16. The laboratory technique called () is used to make neurons responsive to light, such that light stimulation can be used to turn those neurons “on” and “off” at will.[^16]\n17. The () theory of avoidance learning holds that avoidance learning involves an interaction between classical conditioning and operant conditioning. An alternate theory—the () theory—holds that animals choose among possible responses based on the expected outcome of each response.[^17]\n18. Although epinephrine cannot cross the blood–brain barrier, the related neurotransmitter () can enter the brain and affect brain function.[^18]\n19. A () is a classically conditioned response (CR) that is produced in response to a CS that has been paired with an emotion-evoking US.[^19]\n20.

A believer in this principle (), reasoned that a sensory stimulus and motor response follow a pathway known as the ().[^3]\n4. According to Darwin, a trait can evolve through () if it is inheritable, variable, and ().[^4]\n5. A contemporary of William James, () proposed that the psychology of memory can be defined precisely through mathematical laws as a rigorous natural science.[^5]\n6. How memory deteriorates over time is known as () Measuring how much information is retained at various intervals of time following learning, Ebbinghaus was able to plot a ().[^6]\n7. Thorndike referred to the training in which organisms learn to make certain responses in order to obtain or avoid important consequences as (), which is now also known commonly as ().[^7]\n8. Emerging in the 1920s, the American approach to learning known as () centered around the argument that psychology should exclusively study observable behaviors.[^8]\n9. Although the work of () is no longer considered relevant today, his students and followers carried on toward developing mathematical equations to explain learning.[^9]\n10. In ()’s law of (), behaviors that lead to desirable consequences are ()\nlikely to happen again in the future[^10]\n11. Edward Tolman, a neo-behaviorist, argued that his rats, intrinsically motivated to learn the general layout of mazes, had formed (), internal psychological representations of the external world.[^11]\n12.

*Opponent Process Theory*: a way for organisms to maintain emotional stability\n        - Two emotional processes: one that is pleasurable and one that is less pleasant\n        - Repeated experiences have different effects on the initial reaction versus the rebound reaction, causing the initial response to habituate faster than the rebound\n- What is the difference between familiarity and priming?\n    - Familiarity requires conscious sense; priming does not\n    - *Familiarity*\n        - Exposure based learning\n        - An organism typically responds more to a novel stimulus than to a stimulus it was **previously exposed** to, providing evidence of .\n    -

*Statistical learning*\n        - Learning driven by repeated exposures to perceptual events that increases the familiarity and distinctiveness of those events.\n- How can you explain perceptual learning by the [[Dual process theory]]\n    - Exposure to shared features among stimulus would cause one to habituate twice\n    - Exposure to unique features of stimulus would only habituate once\n    - Thus, the unique features are habituated less, making it more likely to provoke response\n- *Spatial learning*\n    -

In long-term habituation, some sensory-motor synapses actually [[Pruning|pruned]] away\n    - Habituation is *homosynaptic* (occurring in one synapse without affecting nearby synapses.)\n- Mechanisms for sensitization\n    - [[Aplysia Withdrawal Reflex]]\n    - Repeated exposure activate interneuron carrying [[neuromodulators]] such as [[Serotonin]]\n        - Serotonin increase the glutamate vesicles available\n    - Cause action potential to fire at a stronger response\n    - Sensitization is *heterosynaptic* (involves changes in several synapses)\n    - Calcium channels respond to the action potentials, but they don't contribute to the activation of the action potentia\n- Mechanisms for perceptual learning\n    -

The relationship between a US and a UR does/does not involve learning[^1]\n2. In eyeblink conditioning, the blink is both a(n) () and a(n) () , although they differ in their ().[^2]\n3. In most conditioning paradigms, extinction is faster/slower than the original acquisition of the conditioned response.[^3]\n- [?] 4. () conditioned responses in the body are most often the result of a biological mechanism called ()[^4]\n5. Evidence that extinction is more than just unlearning comes primarily from studies that look at shifts in () between learning and testing.[^5]\n6. When two cues compete to predict a US or other outcome, the one that is most strongly learned is usually the cue that is learned (), as revealed in studies of blocking.[^6]\n7. Latent inhibition cannot be explained by the Rescorla–Wagner model because during pre-exposure, there is no ().[^7]\n8. Beneath the () cells of the cerebellar cortex lie the cerebellar deep nuclei, including the () nucleus. [^8]\n9. CS information travels up to the deep nuclei of the cerebellum along axon tracts called the ()[^9]\n10. An airpuff US to the eye activates neurons in the () a structure in the lower part of the brainstem[^10]\n11.

Animals with lesions to the cerebellum show CRs, but they are ()[^12]\n13. Latent inhibition and other expressions of CS modulation are impaired or eliminated by lesions to the . ()[^13]\n14. The neural mechanism for habituation is thought to be a progressive decrease in the number of vesicles containing the neurotransmitter () neuron’s axon.[^14]\n15. The () of the sensory neuron’s release of glutamate onto the motor neuron is a presynaptic form of  ()[^15]\n16. Two proteins found inside neurons play critical regulatory roles in the synapse-creation process. The first protein, CREB-1, activates genes in the neuron’s nucleus that () the growth of new synapses. The second protein, CREB-2, () the actions of CREB-1. [^16]\n17. Rats can be protected from overdose by the () they acquired through the administration of lower doses of heroin in the same setting[^17]\n18.

Invoke one's motivation (explicit or implicit) to change biases\n    - What is the least successful ways to change bias\n        - When people are induced with threat, will evoke biases\n        - Self affirmation (reinforce self image)\n        - Specific moods/emotions would not change biases much\n    - What are the 3 puzzles about implicit bias and ways to resolve it\n        1. Replicable implicit bias on **average for a group**, and constantly **shifting individual scores**\n            - IAT might be helpful for indicating a group/culture context, but less useful for assessing individual differences\n            - The individual differences cancels out/washed out in large group statistics\n        2. Same effects across ages\n            - \u003e If one’s biases are not stable across a month, how can they be stable across a lifetime?\n            - [[322 - L6#^85b107|Group Norm Theory]]: the dominate group will have the right to express and pass on their values (older onto younger generation) keeps consistency ^38f177\n            - Developmental: values from the adolescent will continue\n            - Measuring attitude specific moment in specific place, thus less associated with individual attitude across time\n        3. Individual differences in implicit bias predict behaviour only weakly\n            - Implicit bias much more strongly associated with disparate outcomes when examined at aggregate levels (nations, states, metropolitan areas)\n            - IAT might be a better test for structural bias rather than individual bias, indicates more about the structure about group\n    - What is the concept of accessibility\n        - *Concept accessibility*\n            - The likelihood that a thought, evaluation, stereotype, trait, or other piece of information will be **retrieved for use**\n        - **NOT association** but **accessibility** of that association\n            - Payne et al. propose that ` implicit bias` (measured by IAT) reflects the **accessibility** of concepts linked to a social category\n    - What should be done for implicit bias training\n        - On-going conversation, instead of one-case-only stereotypes\n        - Examine the motivation factors to seek opportunities to induce change\n        - Accessibility of bias links (simple awareness might induce further bias, but addition of motivation to change will make this effective)\n- Masculine Defaults\n    - What is the difference between masculine defaults and differential treatment?\n        - \n            |                      | Masculine defaults | Differential treatment |\n            |----------------------|--------------------|------------------------|\n            | Definitions          | Characteristics and behaviours associated with the male gender role are **valued, rewarded, or _considered standard_, normal, neutral, or necessary** aspects of a given culture  | Women are explicitly or implicitly **treated or judged more _negatively_ than men** |\n            | Who is disadvantages | Women and men who have a **_mismatch_ with characteristics and behaviours associated with the male gender role** and women who encounter **backlash for not fitting the female gender role** | Women |\n            | Result               | Historically-derived cultural ideas that characteristics and behaviours associated with the **male gender role are _superior_ or necessary**, standard, neutral, or normal; neglecting ways that women on average differ from men | Historically-derived cultural ideas that **women are less competent** and do not fit into majority-male cultures |\n            | Looks like           | Absence of negative treatment or judgment of women and thus **may not appear overtly discriminatory on surface** | Explicit or implicit negative evaluation or mistreatment |\n            | Assessment           | A cultural feature values, reward, or regards as standard, normal, neutral, or necessary characteristics and behaviours associated with the male gender role, even if it appears equitable on the surface | Women are treated or evaluated more negatively than men |\n            | Remedy               | Creating a balanced culture that **does not privilege characteristics and behaviours associated with the male** gender role over those associated with the female gender role OR **disassociate gender role** with characteristics, make them neutral | Eliminating negative treatment or judgment of women relative to men | ^fc6813\n- Coalitions \u0026 Well-being\n    - *Well-being*\n        - Self-esteem, depression, anxiety, life satisfaction, control, positive well-being, positive affect, negative affect, stress, flourishing\n        - Perceived discrimination does lead to worse well-being (worse for minority groups than majority groups) \n        - Ingroup identification does not robustly buffer against this effect across samples\n    - [[Social Self#Self Esteem]]\n        - “There is ample evidence of ‘inferiority’ feelings and of morbid self-hate in all minority groups.” (Erikson, 1956)\n            - Racial position model\n        - “Group oppression may destroy the integrity of the ego entirely, and reverse its normal pride, and create a groveling self-image,” (Allport, 1954)\n    - [[Self-fulfilling prophecies]]\n        - Predicts: even if unaware of others’ negative expectations, a stigmatized person will come to see themselves in ways consistent with negative stereotypes\n        - Perceiver acts on initially false beliefs in a way that leads the target to behaviourally confirm this belief\n    - Efficacy-based self-esteem approaches\n        - The self-concept develops through efficacious interaction with the environment.

ATTRIBUTIONS\n        - Attributing negative feedback to one’s group membership (i.e., “it’s not me, it’s them and their stereotypes of my group”)\n    2. INGROUP COMPARISONS\n        - Segregated environments (proximity effect): more likely exposed to ingroup than outgroup members (for some stigmas)\n        - To obtain accurate self-evaluations (similarity effect): my group more similar on other attributes (e.g., comparing my salary to other women’s salary)\n        - To avoid unpleasant or painful social comparisons (self-protective effect): avoiding painful comparisons with those who have had advantages you have not had\n    3. SELECTIVE VALUING\n        - Devaluing those performance dimensions on which they or their group fare poorly\n        - Valuing those dimensions on which they or their group excels\n        - Can be socially produced – receiving feedback (positive or negative), comparing to others, being discriminated against or advantaged in certain areas\n        - Prediction: to the extent that members of stigmatized groups do poorly, are targets of negative feedback, or receive poor outcomes because of prejudice, they will place less importance on this dimension than will individuals who are not stigmatized\n\n\n\n# Active Studying\n\n#### Summarize today's lecture\n\n- [::Most important/focused topic]\n- [::Most difficult part, why, how to resolve]\n\n\n#### What part I didn't understand, next step actions?\n","lastmodified":"2023-05-10T19:08:03.578968457Z","tags":["Note"]},"/UofT-Notes/PSY322/PSY322-L9":{"title":"PSY322: - L9","content":"\n# Lecture\n\n- `PDF`:\n    - [[322 - S9.pdf]]\n- [[Social Self#Self Esteem]]\n- Identifying bias in ourselves\n    - Self-enhancement such as the bias blindspot (e.g., “others are definitely biased, but I’m not)\n    - Pronin et al (2002) ^b255e4\n        - [[Better Than Average Effect]]\n        - \u003cimg src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mel10c/image/main/obsidian/20230315124135.png\" width=300/\u003e\n    - [[322 - L7#^9aa9da|Aversive racism]]\n- Moral Credentials\n    - Many people seek to maintain a non-prejudice;d self image\n    - When they have recently had an opportunity to act non-prejudiced, concern is temporarily lifted\n    - Acting non-prejudiced = “moral credentials”\n    - Implication: Does this idea mean people may be more likely to act prejudiced if they perceive themselves to have enough moral credentials?\n    - Takeaway: People are **_more likely_ to express bias when they have established moral credentials**\n- Motivations to avoid prejudice ^3be23d\n    - *Internal*: motivated to behave in accordance with **personally** held nonprejudiced beliefs\n        - Lead to more focus on the needs of their interaction **partner**, remember more of what the interaction partner shares\n        - Lead to focus on **approaching a positive interaction**, treating interaction partner with respect\n    - *External*: motivated to respond without prejudice to **comply with nonprejudiced social norms** and to avoid disapproval from others\n        - Lead one to focus on **themselves**\n        - Lead one to **avoid responding** in a negative/prejudiced way\n    - Research Results\n        - |               | Low Internal  | High Internal |\n        |---------------|---------------|---------------|\n        | Low External  | 🟥 Highest IAT | 🟩 Lowest IAT |\n        | High External | 🟨 Medium IAT | 🟨 Medium IAT |\n        - People with high external motivations, their IAT scores is not affected by their internal motivations\n        - People with low external motivations, their IAT scores is heavily influential by their internal motivations\n- Motivation to express prejudice\n    - *Internal*: “My beliefs motivate me to express negative views about gay men.” \n    - *External*: “If I expressed positive feelings about gay men, I would be concerned that others would be angry with me.”\n\n\n# Active Studying\n\n#### Summarize today's lecture\n\n- [::Most important/focused topic]\n- [::Most difficult part, why, how to resolve]\n\n#### What part I didn't understand, next step actions?\n","lastmodified":"2023-05-10T19:08:03.578968457Z","tags":["Note"]},"/UofT-Notes/PSY322/PSY322-Reading-1":{"title":"PSY322 Reading 1","content":"\n\n# Topics\n\n- `DUE` [[2023-01-25]]\n- `WEIGHT`: $10\\%$\n\n\n\n# Contents\n\n- Instructions:\n    - Pay attention to any figures or graphs in the articles, even if they are not directly referred to below.

T. (2001). Ambivalent sexism. Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, 33, 115-188. [115-123]\n\n1. What is ambivalent sexism theory, and what are the two overarching types of sexism that this theory identifies?\n    - ==Ambivalent Sexism Theory==: highlights the coexistence of power differences and intimate interdependence between the sexes.\n    1. *Hostility sexism* (HS)\n        - Sexist antipathy toward women\n    2. *Benevolence sexism* (BS)\n        1. subjectively favorable, yet patronizing beliefs about women\n1. What are the three domains of ambivalent sexism, and how are they related to social structures?\n    1. Patriarchy\n        - Evolution: men are more strongly oriented toward **obtaining social status and resources**\n        - Male dominance continues via gendered **divisions of labour**\n        - Cultural differences\n            - Nonhierarchical culture: male status striving is minimized\n            - Steeply hierarchical cultures, male status striving is exacerbated\n        - *Dominative paternalism* (家长): the belief that men ought to have more power than women and the corresponding fear that women might manage to usurp men's power\n    2. Gender differentiation\n        - Gender constitutes the most fundamental **group distinction** (first dimension of [[Social categorization]])\n            - Produce in-group favoritism and intergroup competition, generating hostility toward out-group\n        - *Competitive gender differentiation*: underlying belief that as a group **women** are ultimately **inferior** to men on **competence-related dimensions** (HS)\n        - *Complementary gender differentiation*: the belief that women are the better sex, but only in ways suiting lower status, gender-conventional roles (BS)\n    3. Heterosexual reproduction\n        - Sexuality can be a tool of domination\n            - In a society in which sexual violence is common, women find it in their self-interests to procure male protectors by forming exclusive romantic attachments to a male partner\n            - Men often view women proprietarily, and affection can turn to violence, particularly given suspected infidelity\n            - Perpetrators use traditional notions stressing wives' obedience and fidelity to justify violence toward domestic partners\n            - Men's fearful and hostile attitudes toward seductive women or \" femme fatales\" is pervasive.\n        - *Heterosexual hostility*: a component of HS that fuses sex with power and express the belief in women's sexuality as dangerous to men\n        - *Heterosexual intimacy*: heterosexual romantic relationships are essential for true happiness in life for both sexes\n1. What are some of the consequences of hostile sexism and benevolent sexism?\n    - Subjectively benevolent beliefs about women serve to justify promote, and maintain gender inequality, still, many women find BS attractive.\n    - Cultural level: interlocking beliefs that reflect a system of rewards (BS) and punishment (HS) that forces women to accept, rather than challenge the power differences.\n    - Individual level: HS predicts hostility toward women (challenging men's power), BS predicts benevolence toward women (enact gender roles, fulfill men's needs)\n2. Describe and differentiate between competitive and complementary gender differentiation, with an example for each.\n    - *Competitive gender differentiation*: belief that as a group, women are ultimately inferior to men on competence-related dimensions\n    - *Complementary gender differentiation*: belief that women are the better sex, but only in ways suiting lower status, gender-conventional roles\n\n### Social identity theory\n\n\u003e Hornsey, M. J. (2008). Social identity theory and self-categorization theory: A historical review. Social and Personality Psychology Compass, 2, 204-222.\n\n1. What are “social identity theory”, “self-categorization theory”, and “the social identity approach”?\n    - [[Social Identity Theory]]\n        - Human interactions ranges on a **spectrum** from being purely interpersonal to purely intergroup.\n            - *Interpersonal*: people relating entirely as individuals, with no awareness of social categories (rare)\n            - *Purely intergroup*: people relate entirely as representatives of their groups(你是五班的人 出去代表的就是五班)\n        - **Sliding** from the interpersonal `--\u003e` intergroup results in shifts in how people perceive themselves and each other\n    - [[Social categorization]]\n        - Categorization occurs as a function of both accessibility and fit\n        - Categorized identity as operating at different levels of inclusiveness\n            1. *Human identity*: superordinate category of the self as human being\n            2. *Social identity*: intermediate level of the self as a **member of a social group** as defined against other groups of humans\n            3. [[Social Self|Personal identity]]: subordinate level of personal self-categorizations based on interpersonal comparisons\n2. How are social identity theory and self-categorization theory the same? How are they different?\n    - Social identity theory focuses on how group memberships **guide intergroup behavior** and influence an individual's self-concept. \n    - Self-categorization is an individual's **evaluation of the in-group**. To reach positive evaluations of one's own in-group, people engage in processes of social comparison\n3. What is the minimal group paradigm? Why is it used in research? ^81fcce\n    - *Minimal group paradigm*: participants were allocated into groups on the basis of meaningless and arbitrary criteria.\n    - Reason: participants were obeying a predictable pattern of responding, and one that was difficult to explain according to traditional theories of intergroup relations.\n    - Allow people to examine intergroup behaviour in highly controlled way\n4. What are some strategies people use to create a positive social identity when their group is low status, according to social identity theory?\n    - Leaving the group (physically or psychologically)\n    - Making downward intergroup comparisons, focus only on dimensions to make the in group look good, devaluing dimensions that reflect poorly on the in group\n    - Engaging in social change to overturn the existing status hierarchy\n5. What is depersonalization, according to the social identity approach?\n    - People cognitively represent their social groups in terms of prototypes. When a category becomes salient, people come to see themselves and other category members **less as individuals** and more **as interchangeable exemplars of the group prototype**.\n6. What is deindividuation, according to the social identity approach?\n    - A shift in identity from the personal to the social level\n7. What are some ways that social identity research has changed over time?\n    - The motivation for distinctiveness and self-definition has replaced self-esteem as the most researched motive for group behaviour\n8. What are major criticisms of the social identity approach, according to this article?\n    - The theory has become so broad and powerful that it ceases to be falsifiable, as virtually any experimental outcome can be interpreted within its overarching framework\n    - Its focus on individual processes and social cognition, the theory suffers from some of the flaws it points out in others; namely being too reductionist and individualistic\n9. What do you think are the social identity approach’s strengths and weaknesses?\n    - Strength\n        - Good way of understanding human behavior, i.e. ethnocentrism, favoritism, conformity, serotyping.\n        - Assumes intergroup conflict is not required for discrimination to occur (Tajfel, 1970)\n        - Established + of in-group by establishing the – of the out-group\n    - Weakness\n        - Describes, but does not  accurately predict  human behavior.  \n        - Why is our personal  identity stronger than  our group identity at  times?  \n        - It fails to take into  account the  environment  \n            - Cultural expectations  \n            - Rewards  \n            - Social constraints  (poverty)\n\n\n### Dehumanization\n\n\u003e Kteily, N. S., \u0026 Bruneau, E. (2017). Darker demons of our nature: The need to (re) focus attention on blatant forms of dehumanization. Current Directions in Psychological Science, 26(6), 487-494.\n\n1. What is blatant dehumanization? Why do authors believe that we should re-focus our attention on this?\n    - The overt and explicitly communicated belief that **a person(s) is less human than another**\n    - Especially pernicious because those who express it are aware that they are denying targets full humanity\n    - Anecdotal evidence suggests that such dehumanization remains relevant in modern societies.\n2. Describe the method that is commonly used to measure blatant dehumanization.\n    - Implicit Association Test (cognitive association with in-group vs. out-group)\n    - Ascent (asses active brain regions during judgements)\n    - Feeling thermometers (asses emotional response during judgement)\n3. What are the four factors that drive blatant dehumanization?\n    1. Status\n    2. Sense of threat/presents of conflict\n    3. Individual differences\n    4. Degree to which people believe that a target group denies humanity to their own\n4. How does meta-dehumanization differ from outgroup dehumanization?\n    - *Meta-dehumanization*: people believe that a target group denies humanity **to their own**\n    - *Outgroup dehumanization*: denies huamnity **toward outgroup**\n5. What are some (individual and contextual) moderators that predict differences in the levels of blatant dehumanization?\n    - Individual difference moderators: Social Dominance Orientation Right Wing Authoritarianism System Justiﬁcation\n    - Contextual moderators: Perceived legitimacy Perceived threat History of conﬂict Intergroup contact Group status\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-05-10T19:08:03.578968457Z","tags":["Note"]},"/UofT-Notes/PSY322/PSY322-Reading-4":{"title":"PSY322 Reading 4","content":"\n# Topics\n\n - `DUE` [[2023-03-15]]\n\n## Readings\n\n- [@2019BOGART-BornThatWay]\n    - What is the authors’ central idea?

How is each relevant to understanding disability stigma?  \n        - Essentialism\n            - *Essentialism* is the belief that there is an **inherent and immutable nature to certain categories**, including disabilities. \n            - It suggests that individuals with disabilities are fundamentally different from those without disabilities and that these **differences are fixed and unchangeable**. \n            - Essentialism can **lead to stigmatization and discrimination** towards people with disabilities.\n        - Attributions\n            - *Attribution theories*, on the other hand, refer to **the ways in which people make judgments about the causes of events or behaviors**. \n                - These theories seek to explain why people behave in certain ways and attribute these behaviors to different causes, such as internal factors like personality traits or external factors like situational circumstances. \n            - Attribution theories are relevant to understanding disability stigma because they can shape the ways in which people view and treat individuals with disabilities.\n        - Relevance\n            - For example, people may **attribute a congenital disability to internal factors**, such as *genetics*, and therefore view the individual as being fundamentally different from others. \n            - In contrast, they may **attribute an acquired disability to external factors**, such as a *traumatic accident*, and view the **individual as being responsible for their disability**, leading to blame and stigma. These attributional processes can have a significant impact on the experiences of individuals with disabilities and can shape the ways in which they are treated by society.\n    - How did the authors test their hypotheses and research questions? How did the three studies differ from one another?  \n        - Study 1\n            - Study 1 involved an *online survey* that was completed by 360 participants, who were asked to **rate their level of agreement with statements** that were designed to measure beliefs about people with congenital versus acquired disabilities. \n            - The results showed that participants were more likely to view individuals with **congenital disabilities as helpless and dependent,** while those with **acquired disabilities were viewed as more responsible for their condition**.\n        - Study 2\n            - Study 2 involved a *laboratory experiment* in which 73 participants were **asked to rate their level of agreement with statements** that attributed responsibility for a hypothetical disability to either genetic or lifestyle factors. \n            - The results showed that participants were **more likely to attribute responsibility for a disability to lifestyle factors when it was described as acquired**, compared to when it was described as congenital.\n        - Study 3\n            - Study 3 involved a *second laboratory experiment* with 148 participants, who were asked to **read a hypothetical scenario about a person** with either a congenital or acquired disability and **rate their level of agreement with statements** that were designed to measure stigma. \n            - The results showed that participants **stigmatized individuals with congenital disabilities more than those with acquired disabilities**.\n    - What variables were manipulated in Study 3, and how did the authors manipulate them?  \n        - Manipulation target\n            - The authors manipulated two variables: **the type of disability** (congenital vs. acquired) and the age of onset of the disability (early childhood vs. adulthood).\n        - Method\n            - Created **two different hypothetical scenarios** in which the disability was either congenital or acquired. In the congenital condition, the individual had a disability from birth, while in the acquired condition, the individual developed the disability later in life.\n            - To manipulate the **age of onset of the disability**, the authors included information about the age at which the disability began in each of the scenarios. In the early childhood condition, the disability began before the age of five, while in the adulthood condition, the disability began after the age of 18.\n        - Experiment\n            - Participants in Study 3 were **randomly assigned to one of the four conditions**: *congenital/early childhood, congenital/adulthood, acquired/early childhood, or acquired/adulthood*. After reading the scenario, participants were asked to rate their level of agreement with statements that were designed to measure stigma towards the individual with the disability.\n    - What did the studies find? What conclusions do the authors draw about their findings?\n        - Individual studies\n        - First, they argue that **the belief that individuals with _congenital disabilities_ are helpless and dependent is a form of _essentialism_ that reinforces the stereotype of disability as a tragedy**. \n        - Second, they suggest that the tendency to **_attribute_ responsibility for acquired disabilities to lifestyle factors is a form of _victim-blaming_ that reinforces the stereotype of disability as a personal failure.** \n        - Finally, they argue that the stigmatization of individuals with congenital disabilities can have **negative consequences for their self-esteem, social relationships, and access to resources and support**. The authors call for a more inclusive and accepting society that recognizes the abilities and contributions of people with disabilities, regardless of the nature of their disability.\n- [@2016CRAIG-StigmaBasedSolidarityUnderstanding]\n    - \u003cimg src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mel10c/image/main/obsidian/20230313110417.png\" width=400/\u003e\n    - According to the authors, under what conditions would people be more likely to show coalitional, rather than derogatory, attitudes toward other stigmatized people?  \n        1.  Perceived *commonality*: \n            - When individuals perceive that they **share similar stigmatized identities with members of other stigmatized groups**, they are more likely to **show _coalitional_ attitudes toward them**. \n            - The **greater the perceived similarity** or overlap between stigmatized groups, the more likely individuals are to **view members of other groups as _potential allies_** rather than competitors.\n        2.  Perceived *threat*: \n            - When individuals perceive a **common threat from an external source**, such as discrimination or prejudice from the dominant group, they are more likely to **show coalitional attitudes toward other stigmatized groups**. \n            - In such situations, individuals may perceive that they share a common enemy and may be more willing to **work together to _fight against this common threat_**.\n        3.  Perceived *legitimacy*:\n            - When individuals perceive that members of other stigmatized groups **face similar levels of prejudice and discrimination as they do**, they are more likely to show coalitional attitudes toward them. \n            - In other words, if individuals view members of other stigmatized groups as legitimately stigmatized, they may be more **likely to *empathize* with them and view them as allies.**\n        - In contrast, individuals are more likely to **show derogatory attitudes** toward members of other stigmatized groups **when they perceive these groups as _different_ from their own**, when they perceive them as less legitimate, or when they **view them as competitors for limited resources**.\n    - What are three ways to facilitate more coalitional attitudes among people of different stigmatized groups?  \n        1. Explicitly connecting the in-group to another stigmatized group\n            - Encouraging members of different stigmatized groups to **interact with each other** can help promote coalitional attitudes by breaking down barriers and promoting a sense of shared identity\n            - Common experiences or challenges are also associated with more coalitional attitudes among stigmatized groups\n            - Emphasizing the **shared experiences and commonalities** between stigmatized groups can help promote coalitional attitudes by highlighting the similarities rather than the differences between groups.\n        1. Meaning making\n            - Encouraging members of stigmatized groups to work together to **achieve shared goals** can help promote coalitional attitudes by fostering a sense of collective efficacy.\n        2. Personal connection to stigmatization\n            Reflecting on one’s personal connection to discrimination may facilitate sympathy with groups stigmatized across dimensions of identity.\n    - What variables do the authors argue will moderate these effects (i.e., “caveats”)?\n        1. Zeo-sum perceptions (inter-group competition)\n            - Perceptions of contexts as **zero-sum or otherwise competitive** may shape the emergence of coalitions\n            - Perceiving that a similarly low-status out-group is increasing in status or resources tends to evoke more negative attitudes toward the “progressing” group\n            - Intraminority coalitions are more likely if **both groups can attain better outcomes together** (i.e., they have common goals), compared to if only one group can attain a valued goal\n        2. Positive contact with the dominant group (Issue relevance to discrimination)\n            - Positive contact with members of the dominant group or the presumed perpetrating group **reduces solidarity among stigmatized groups**.\n        3. Prejudice-expression norms\n            - Perceptions that members of powerful, **dominant groups expect the expression** of prejudice can lead stigmatized-group members to publicly (but not privately) express prejudice toward a member of another stigmatized group\n        4. Position of groups in society (proximity to mainstream)\n            - Stigmatized groups’ **relative status in society** can also shape intraminority intergroup relations. Minority group members **often express greater bias against groups perceived to be closer to the mainstream**\n- ★ [@2022FROST-SocialChangeRelationship]\n    - What is minority stress? What does prior literature suggest about how it affects sexual minority individuals?  \n        - Minority stress\n            - *Minority stress*: the **chronic stressors** that individuals from marginalized or stigmatized groups experience **as a result of their minority status**. \n            - In the context of sexual minority individuals, minority stress refers to the **stressors that lesbian, gay, bisexual, and queer individuals face as a result of their sexual orientation**.\n        - Effects on sexual minority\n            - Prior literature has suggested that minority stress can have **negative consequences for the mental and physical health** of sexual minority individuals. \n            - This stress can arise from **experiences of discrimination, victimization, and rejection from others**, as well as from **internalized homophobia, or negative attitudes and beliefs** that individuals may internalize about their own sexual orientation.\n        - ==Minority stress model== ^3cc37f\n            - The *minority stress model* proposed by Meyer (2003) posits that minority stress can lead to a range of negative outcomes for sexual minority individuals, including **increased risk of depression, anxiety, substance abuse, and suicide**. \n            - Minority stress can also impact the quality of sexual minority individuals' relationships, as it can lead to **decreased intimacy, relationship satisfaction, and commitment**\n    - What is the social change hypothesis?  \n        - ==Social change hypothesis==\n            - Changing social and legal attitudes toward sexual minorities may lead to **improvements in the quality of same-sex relationships**\n            - The hypothesis suggests that as society becomes **more accepting** of sexual minorities and provides **legal protections** for same-sex couples, sexual minorities may experience fewer stressors related to their minority status and may be better able to form and maintain high-quality relationships\n        - Contrast with [[#^3cc37f|minority stress model]]\n            - The social change hypothesis contrasts with the minority stress model, which suggests that even in the face of changing social and legal attitudes, **sexual minorities may continue to experience stressors related to their minority status** that impact their relationships. \n            - This paper aims to investigate the extent to which the social change hypothesis holds true, and to explore whether minority stress still plays a significant role in the quality of same-sex relationships in the current social and legal climate.\n    - What is the main idea that this study was testing? What is the logic for this idea?  \n        - Main idea\n            - The main idea that this study was **testing is whether the social change hypothesis**, which suggests that changes in societal attitudes and legal protections for sexual minorities may improve the quality of same-sex relationships, holds true in the current social and legal climate. \n        - Logic\n            - The logic behind this idea is that **as society becomes more accepting of sexual minorities and provides legal protections for same-sex couples, sexual minorities may experience fewer stressors** related to their minority status, which in turn may lead to better relationship quality.\n    - What methods did the authors use to study this idea?\n        - Ideas\n            - Test this idea by examining the relationship between *social change variables* (such as societal acceptance of sexual minorities, legal recognition of same-sex relationships, and public support for same-sex marriage) and *relationship quality variables* (such as intimacy, relationship satisfaction, and commitment) among a sample of same-sex couples. The study also aimed to explore the extent to which *minority stress variables* (such as experiences of discrimination and internalized homophobia) still play a role in the quality of same-sex relationships, even in the context of changing social and legal attitudes toward sexual minorities.\n        - Method\n            - The authors used a **cross-sectional survey design**. They recruited a sample of 822 individuals who were currently in a same-sex relationship and had been in that relationship for at least six months\n            - Participants completed an **online survey** that assessed a range of variables related to social change (such as societal acceptance of sexual minorities, legal recognition of same-sex relationships, and public support for same-sex marriage) and relationship quality (such as intimacy, relationship satisfaction, and commitment). Participants also completed measures of minority stress, such as experiences of discrimination and internalized homophobia.\n            - The authors used **regression analyses** to examine the relationships between social change variables and relationship quality variables, and to explore the extent to which minority stress variables mediated or moderated these relationships. They also conducted exploratory analyses to examine potential differences in these relationships based on factors such as gender, race/ethnicity, and age.\n    - What did the study find? How strong do you find the evidence to be for their hypotheses?\n        - Result\n            - The study found **partial support for the social change hypothesis**, which suggests that *changes in societal attitudes and legal protections for sexual minorities may improve the quality of same-sex relationships*. Specifically, the study found that *societal acceptance* of sexual minorities and **legal recognition** of same-sex relationships were **positively associated with intimacy, relationship satisfaction, and commitment** among same-sex couples. Public support for same-sex marriage was positively associated with intimacy and commitment, but not with relationship satisfaction\n            - However, the study also found that **minority stress variables**, such as experiences of discrimination and internalized homophobia, were **negatively associated with relationship** quality among same-sex couples, and partially mediated the relationship between social change variables and relationship quality\n            - The evidence for the hypotheses was **moderately strong,** as the study used a large sample size and statistical analyses to examine the relationships between variables. However, the study was cross-sectional, which means that it cannot establish causal relationships between variables. Additionally, the study relied on *self-report measures, which may be subject to biases and limitations*. Future research that uses longitudinal or experimental designs may provide stronger evidence for the social change hypothesis and its relationship with same-sex relationship quality.\n\n## Lectures\n\n- [[322 - L7]]\n- [[322 - L8]]","lastmodified":"2023-05-10T19:08:03.578968457Z","tags":["Note"]},"/UofT-Notes/PSY322/PSY322-Reading-5":{"title":"PSY322 Reading 5","content":"\n\n# Topics\n\n - `DUE` [[2023-03-29]]\n\n# Readings\n\n- ★ [@2010DIXON-LetThemEat] ^ae084a\n    - How does contact affect advantaged and disadvantaged groups? (What are similarities and differences in these effects?)  \n        - Similarities\n            1.  **Positive contact** can lead to reduced prejudice and improved attitudes towards the disadvantaged group.\n            2.  **Direct contact**, such as face-to-face interaction, is generally more effective than indirect contact, such as exposure to media representations of the disadvantaged group.\n            3.  The effectiveness of contact in reducing prejudice is influenced by the **quality and frequency** of the contact.\n        - Differences \n            1.  For advantaged groups, positive contact with a disadvantaged group can lead to feelings of **guilt, shame, or discomfort**. This may lead to a *backlash effect*, where the advantaged group becomes defensive or even more prejudiced towards the disadvantaged group.\n            2.  For disadvantaged groups, positive contact with the advantaged group can lead to feelings of **empowerment, increased self-esteem, and reduced anxiety or stress**.\n            3.  The *context* of the contact can also affect its effectiveness. For example, contact in a **professional or academic setting** may be more effective for reducing prejudice than contact in a casual or social setting.\n    - What are three explanations the authors provide for the ironic effects of contact?  \n        1.  **Threats** to group identity\n            - Contact between groups can threaten the identity of the advantaged group, leading them to feel a sense of loss or threat to their own group identity. \n            - This can result in increased prejudice and negative attitudes towards the disadvantaged group as a way of reasserting their own group identity.\n        2.  Intergroup **anxiety**\n            - Contact between groups can lead to increased anxiety or discomfort, particularly for the advantaged group, who may feel pressure to perform well or avoid appearing prejudiced. \n            - This anxiety can actually increase negative attitudes and prejudice towards the disadvantaged group.\n        3.  **Attributional** ambiguity\n            - When members of the advantaged group have positive interactions with members of the disadvantaged group, they may attribute the positive outcomes to *external* factors, such as luck or the situation, rather than to the individual members of the disadvantaged group. \n            - This can result in continued negative attitudes towards the group as a whole, even if the individual members were perceived positively.\n    - How is the collective action model different from the prejudice reduction model?\n        - Goal\n            - The *collective action model* is focused on reducing intergroup conflict and inequality by **promoting collective action** and social change. \n            - In contrast, the *prejudice reduction model* is focused on reducing prejudice and **increasing positive attitudes** between groups through **contact** and other cognitive or behavioral interventions.\n        -  Emphasis on group dynamics\n            - The *collective action model* emphasizes the importance of understanding the **power dynamics** between groups and the role of social norms and institutions in perpetuating inequality. \n            - The *prejudice reduction model*, on the other hand, focuses more on **individual-level processes**, such as attitudes and cognitive biases, and how these can be changed through intervention.\n        -  Emphasis on action:\n            - The *collective action model* emphasizes the **importance of taking action** to address inequality and prejudice, often through collective efforts and social movements. \n            - The *prejudice reduction model*, while it may involve some behavioral change, is more focused on **changing attitudes and beliefs**\n        -  Different interventions\n            - The *collective action model* may involve interventions such as **mobilizing social movements**, creating new **institutions**, or **changing policies** to address inequality. \n            - The *prejudice reduction model*, on the other hand, may involve interventions such as i**ntergroup contact**, perspective-taking exercises, or cognitive re-framing to reduce prejudice.\n- [@2020MOUSA-BuildingSocialCohesion] ^4125c7\n    - What is the contact hypothesis?\n        - *Contact Hypothesis*: intergroup contact, specifically through soccer, can **promote social cohesion** between Christians and Muslims in post-ISIS Iraq ^961d50\n        - Details\n    - What was the prejudice reduction intervention used in this study? How was it implemented (i.e., what was the sample and method)?\n        - The intervention was implemented through a **randomized controlled trial**. The study sample consisted of 1,175 Iraqi Christians who were displaced by ISIS and currently living in displacement camps in Erbil, Iraq. \n        - The participants were randomly assigned to **one of two soccer teams**: an all-Christian team or a team mixed with Muslims. The teams **played each other in a tournament**, and the researchers measured changes in intergroup attitudes and behaviors before and after the tournament\n        - Result found that intergroup contact through soccer led to increased positive attitudes and social cohesion between Christians and Muslims\n    - How did the researcher operationalize intergroup social cohesion? Do you think behavioral and attitudinal outcome scales measured what they purported to measure\n        - They operationalized intergroup social cohesion in her study by using the contact hypothesis\n        - The behavioral outcomes measured in the study included attending mixed dinner events and a joint cultural event, while the attitudinal outcomes measured were perceived discrimination, anxiety towards outgroup members, and in-group bias. The scales used to measure these outcomes were adapted from previous studies and were found to have adequate reliability and validity. However, it is important to note that these scales are not perfect measures of intergroup social cohesion, as they may not capture all aspects of this complex construct.\n        - Overall, while the behavioral and attitudinal outcome scales used in the study m**ay not have captured all aspects of intergroup social cohesion**, they did measure relevant constructs and were found to have **adequate psychometric properties**.\n    - What did the study find? On which DVs did the intervention produce changes? On which did it not produce changes?\n        - The study found that intergroup contact through soccer had a **positive impact on social cohesion between Christians and Muslims** in post-ISIS Iraq.\n        - The intervention resulted in **improved behaviors towards Muslim peers** among Christians, such as expressing less prejudice, more positive attitudes, and greater willingness to interact with Muslims. \n        - The intervention **did not, however, substantially affect behaviors in other social contexts,** such as patronizing a restaurant in Muslim-dominated Mosul or attending a mixed social event \n- [@2019SUE-DisarmingRacialMicroaggressions] ^ae9b5b\n    - What are microaggressions? What are macroaggressions? What is the difference between them? How do they affect people of colour, according to the authors?\n        - *Microaggressions* as \"the **everyday** slights, insults, putdowns, invalidations, and **offensive behaviors that people of color experience in daily interactions** with generally well-intentioned White Americans who may be unaware that they have engaged in racially demeaning ways toward target groups\" \n        - Macroaggressions, on the other hand, are **\"overt and intentional acts of discrimination\"**\n        - Microaggressions can have a significant impact on the mental health and well-being of people of color. These experiences can lead to feelings of anger, frustration, confusion, and helplessness, as well as contribute to anxiety and depression. Moreover, the authors argue that the cumulative effect of microaggressions over time can lead to a sense of alienation and disconnection from mainstream society, which can have a negative impact on the overall quality of life of people of color\n    - Who are targets, allies, and bystanders, according to the authors?\n        - The *targets* refer to individuals **who experience microaggressions** and are the focus of the microintervention strategies. \n        - White *allies* are people who identify as **white and are committed to fighting against racism and promoting equality**. They can use their privilege to disrupt and challenge the microaggressions directed towards targets. \n        - *Bystanders* are individuals who **witness microaggressions but are not the target of such aggression**. Bystanders can intervene in a variety of ways, including speaking up, providing support to the target, or seeking assistance from others to address the situation\n    - What are the four broad types of strategies for addressing microinterventions that the authors identify? What are examples of each kind of microintervention that could be directed toward perpetrator microaggressions, institutional macroaggressions, and societal macroaggressions?\n        - \u003cimg src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mel10c/image/main/obsidian/20230330172147.png\"/\u003e ^201c59\n    - What aspects of this research do you think could apply to other groups (i.e., those defined by something other than race) or other cultural contexts? Why or why not? [note that there is no one right answer to this question, rather it’s a prompt for you to critically consider how you think this work may or may not apply to other contexts]\n        - While the article focuses on race-related bias, it is possible that the concepts and strategies presented could be applied to other forms of bias, such as those related to gender, sexuality, ability, or religion. However, it is important to note that each group's experiences of bias may differ and require unique strategies for intervention and prevention. Additionally, the cultural context in which the bias occurs is also important to consider, as cultural values and norms may affect how bias is perceived and addressed. Therefore, while the framework presented in this article may be a useful starting point for addressing bias in other contexts, it would need to be adapted and tailored to specific groups and cultural contexts.\n- [@2022OKONOFUA-SideliningBiasSituationist] ^47c469\n    - How do the authors conceptualize the self? What are working selves?\n        - The authors conceptualize the *self* as **consisting of multiple working selves**. \n        - **Each working self is a different aspect of a person's identity that can be activated in different situations** and contexts, and can influence behavior and decision-making\n        - The authors propose that interventions based on the sidelining-bias approach aim to **elevate a nonbiased or antibiased alternative self** and ideal goals for which biased behavior would not be functional. By activating a working self that prioritizes these alternative goals, individuals may be less likely to engage in biased behavior \n    - How is the sidelining approach different from common bias-reduction approaches?\n        - One key difference is that the sidelining approach **treats bias (or non-bias, or anti-bias) as an _expression_ of the working self** and the kinds of goals that this self can pursue in a given context. This shifts responsibility and causality from bad individuals to bad situations\n        - Additionally, interventions based on the sidelining approach are designed to **mitigate discrimination by elevating a nonbiased (or antibiased) alternative self** and ideal goals for which biased behavior would not be functional\n        - Overall, the sidelining approach is designed to change the way people see themselves in a given context, rather than simply changing their attitudes or beliefs about others\n    - What interventions are consistent with the sidelining approach? Why would each of these work to sideline bias?\n        - he article provides examples of interventions consistent with the sidelining approach, such as \"asking individuals to reflect on a time when they were successful in not behaving in a biased manner and to consider how they can apply these insights to their current context\" [2]. Another example is \"asking individuals to reflect on an alternative self that is not biased and to consider how they can activate this self in their current context\"\n        - The authors suggest that these interventions work to sideline bias by shifting individuals' focus away from their biases and towards alternative selves and goals that are not biased. By doing so, these interventions can help individuals disengage from biased behaviors and instead engage in behaviors that align with their nonbiased or antibiased alternative selves and goals. This, in turn, can lead to more equitable outcomes in real-world contexts [1].\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-05-10T19:08:03.578968457Z","tags":["Note"]},"/UofT-Notes/PSY424/PSY424-L1":{"title":"PSY424: - L1","content":"\n# Reading\n\n- The Nature and Importance of Intimacy\n    - *The Nature of Intimacy*:\n        - Intimate relationships differ from more casual associations in at least **seven specific ways**: knowledge, interdependence, caring, trust, responsiveness, mutuality, and commitment.\n    - *The Need to Belong*:\n        - Humans display a need to belong, a **drive** to maintain regular interaction with affectionate, intimate partners. Adverse consequences may follow if the need remains unfulfilled over time.\n    - *The Influence of Culture*:\n        - Fewer people are marrying than ever before, and those who do marry wait longer to do so. People routinely cohabit, and that often makes a future divorce more, not less, likely.\n    - *Sources of Change*:\n        - Economic changes, increasing individualism, and new technology contribute to cultural change.\n        - So does the sex ratio; cultures with high sex ratios are characterized by traditional roles for men and women, whereas low sex ratios are correlated with more permissive behavior.\n- The Influence of Experience\n    - Children’s interactions with their caregivers produce different styles of [[attachment]].\n    - These orientations are mostly learned.\n    - Thus, our beliefs about the nature and worth of close relationships are shaped by our experiences within them.\n- The Influence of Individual Differences\n    - There’s wide variation in people’s abilities and preferences, but individual differences are usually gradual and subtle instead of abrupt.\n    - *Sex Differences*:\n        - Despite lay beliefs that men and women are quite different, most sex differences are quite small. The range of variation among members of a given sex is always large compared to the average difference between the sexes, and the overlap of the sexes is so substantial that many members of one sex will always score higher than the average member of the other sex. Thus, the sexes are much more similar than different on most of the topics of interest to relationship science.\n    - *Gender Differences*:\n        - Gender differences refer to social and psychological distinctions that are taught to people by their cultures. Men are expected to be dominant and assertive, women to be warm and emotionally expressive—but a third of us are androgynous and possess both instrumental, task-oriented skills and expressive, social and emotional talents. Men and women who adhere to traditional gender roles do not like each other, either at first meeting or later during a marriage, as much as less stereotyped, androgynous people do.\n    - *Personality*. Personality traits are stable tendencies that characterize people’s thoughts, feelings, and behavior across their whole lives:\n        - Open-mindedness, extraversion, agreeableness, and conscientiousness help produce pleasant relationships, but negative emotionality undermines one’s contentment.\n    - *Self-Esteem*.\n        - What we think of ourselves emerges from our interactions with others: The sociometer theory argues that if others regard us positively, self-esteem is high, but if others don’t want to associate with us, self-esteem is low. People who have low self-esteem undermine and sabotage their close relationships by underestimating their partners’ love for them and overreacting to imagined threats.\n    - *Sexual Orientation*:\n        - Lesbians and gays experience intimacy in the same ways that heterosexuals do, but often enjoy relationships that are more satisfying; there may be advantages—greater equality, better [[communication]], more respect—in having a partner of the same sex. Bisexuals elicit more suspicion, but they, too, prosper in loving relationships.\n- The Influence of Human Nature:\n    - An evolutionary perspective assumes that sexual selection shapes humankind, influenced, in part, by sex differences in parental investment and paternity uncertainty. The sexes pursue different mates when they’re interested in a long, committed relationship than they do when they’re interested in a short-term affair. The evolutionary perspective also assumes that cultural influences determine whether inherited habits are still adaptive—and some of them may not be.\n- The Influence of Interaction:\n    - Relationships result from the combinations of their participants’ histories and talents, and thus are often more than the sum of their parts. Relationships are fluid processes rather than static entities.\n- The Dark Side of Relationships:\n    - There are potential costs, as well as rewards, to intimacy. So why take the risk? Because we are a social species, and we need each other.\n- \u003cu\u003eRelationship Suggestion\u003c/u\u003e\n    - Enter casual cohabitation cautiously. It tends to be less satisfying than marriage usually is.\n    - Put away your phone when it’s time to pay attention to your partner.\n    - Strive to be trusting, relaxed, and comfortable with interdependent intimacy—and seek partners who are, as well.\n    - Seek partners with both instrumental and expressive skills who are competent and self-reliant and warm, compassionate, and tender.\n    - Given a choice, choose an optimistic partner over one who is pessimistic, anxious, and fretful.\n    - Seek partners who deserve to like themselves and do.\n\n\n# Lecture\n\n- `PDF`:\n    - [[424 - S1.pdf]]\n- Intimate Relationships\n    - What is an intimate relationship?\n        - The 7 [[Intimate Relationship#Components|components]] of intimacy\n            - `TIMRKCC`\n                - Not all component is required\n            1.

Even brief, mere exposure to others usually increases our liking for them.\n    - *Convenience: Proximity Is Rewarding, Distance Is Costly*:\n        - Relationships with distant partners are ordinarily less satisfying than they would be if the partners were nearby.\n    - *The Power of Proximity*:\n        - Close proximity makes it more likely that two people will meet and interact, for better or for worse.\n- Physical Attractiveness: Liking Those Who Are Lovely\n    - Our Bias for Beauty: “What Is Beautiful Is Good.” We assume that attractive people have other desirable personal characteristics.\n    - *Who’s Pretty*:\n        - Symmetrical faces with features of average dimensions are especially beautiful. Waist-to-hip ratios of 0.7 are very appealing in women, whereas a WHR of 0.9 is attractive in a man if he has money.\n    - *An Evolutionary Perspective on Physical Attractiveness*:\n        - Cross-cultural agreement about beauty, cyclical variations in women’s desires, and the link between attractiveness and good health are all consistent with the assumptions of evolutionary psychology.\n    - *Culture Counts, Too*:\n        - Standards of beauty also fluctuate with changing economic and cultural conditions.\n    - *Looks Matter*:\n        - When people first meet, nothing else affects attraction as much\n    - *The Interactive Costs and Benefits of Beauty*:\n        - Physical attractiveness has a larger influence on men’s social lives than on women’s. Attractive people doubt the praise they receive from others, but they’re still happier than unattractive people are.\n    - *Matching in Physical Attractiveness*:\n        - People tend to pair off with others of similar levels of beauty.\n- Reciprocity: Liking Those Who Like Us\n    - People are reluctant to risk rejection. Most people calculate others’ overall desirability by multiplying their physical attractiveness by their probability of reciprocal liking. People who are desirable partners—that is, those with high mate value—insist that their partners be desirable, too.\n- Similarity: Liking Those Who Are Like Us\n    - Birds of a feather flock together. People like those who share their attitudes.\n    - *What Kind of Similarity*:\n        - Happy relationship partners resemble each other in demographic origin, attitudes, and, to a lesser degree, in personalities.\n    - *Do Opposites Attract*:\n        - Opposites do not attract, but they may seem to for several reasons. First, we are attracted to those who we think are like us, and we can be wrong. Then, it takes time for perceived similarity to be replaced by more accurate understanding of the attributes we share with others. People may be attracted to those who are mildly different from themselves but similar to their ideal selves. People also tend to become more similar over time, and some types of similarity are more important than others. Matching is also a broad process; fame, wealth, talent, and looks can all be used to attract others. Finally, we may appreciate behavior from a partner that differs from our own but that complements our actions and helps us to reach our goals.\n    - *So, What Do Men and Women Want*:\n        - People evaluate potential partners with regard to (a) warmth and loyalty, (b) attractiveness and vitality, and (c) status and resources. For lasting romances, women want men who are warm and kind and who are not poor, and men want women who are warm and kind and who are not unattractive. Thus, everybody wants intimate partners who are amiable, agreeable, and loving.\n- \u003cu\u003eSuggestions for Relationships\u003c/u\u003e\n    - Proximity is attractive; don’t expect absence to make the heart grow fonder.\n    - Don’t be fooled: A dating site that promises to find a perfect partner for you probably won’t.\n    - Don’t judge a book by its cover; beauty isn’t talent.\n    - Seek friends and lovers with whom you agree on all of the things that are important to you.\n    - Join the crowd: Put a potential partner’s warmth and kindness at the top of your list of priorities.\n\n### Chapter 4\n\n\u003e First Impressions (and Beyond): When we first meet others, we jump to conclusions because of **stereotypes** and **[[primacy effect]]**. **[[Confirmation Bias]]** then affect our selection of subsequent data, and overconfidence leads us to put unwarranted faith in our judgments.\n- The Power of Perceptions:\n    - Partners’ perceptions can be very consequential.\n    - *Idealizing Our Partners*:\n        - Happy partners construct positive illusions that emphasize their partners’ virtues and minimize their faults.\n    - *Attributional Processes*:\n        - The explanations we generate for why things happen are called attributions. Partners are affected by actor/observer effects and self-serving biases, and they tend to employ either relationship-enhancing or distress-maintaining patterns of attribution.\n    - *Memories*. We edit and update our [[Memory]] as time goes by:\n        - This process of reconstructive memory helps couples stay optimistic about their futures.\n    - *Relationship Beliefs*:\n        - Our assumptions about the role marriage will play in our lives take the form of marital paradigms. Dysfunctional relationship beliefs such as destiny beliefs are clearly disadvantageous. Growth beliefs are more realistic and profitable.\n    - *Expectations*.\n        - Our expectations about others can become self-fulfilling prophecies, false predictions that make themselves come true:\n    - *Self-Perceptions*.\n        - We seek reactions from others that are self-enhancing and complimentary and that are consistent with what we already think of ourselves—with selfverification leading people to seek intimate partners who support their existing self-concepts.\n    - *Nonconscious Social Cognition*.\n        - We often have both positive and negative associations with our partners, implicit attitudes, of which we are unaware. We also may not recognize how, through transference, experiences with prior partners can influence our feelings and behavior in current relationships.\n- Impression Management\n    - We try to influence the impressions of us that others form.\n    - *Strategies of Impression Management*.\n        - Four different strategies of impression management—ingratiation, self-promotion, intimidation, and supplication—are commonplace.\n    - *Impression Management in Close Relationships*.\n        - High self-monitors are less committed to their romantic partners, but all of us work less hard to present favorable images to our intimate partners than to others.\n- So, Just How Well Do We Know Our Partners?\n    - We generally don’t understand our partners as well as we think we do.\n    - *Knowledge*.\n        - As a relationship develops and partners spend more time together, they typically do understand each other better.\n    - *Motivation*.\n        - The interest and motivation with which people try to figure each other out help to determine how insightful and accurate they will be.\n    - *Partner Legibility*.\n        - Some personality traits, such as extraversion, are more visible than others.\n    - *Perceiver Ability*.\n        - Some judges are better than others, too. Emotional intelligence is important in this regard.\n    - *Threatening Perceptions*.\n        - However, when accurate perceptions would be worrisome, intimate partners may actually be motivated to be inaccurate.\n    - *Perceiver Influence*.\n        - Perceptions that are initially inaccurate may become more correct as we induce our partners to become the people we want them to be.\n- \u003cu\u003eSuggestions for relationships\u003c/u\u003e\n    - Humility is attractive. Strive to be humble instead of overconfident in your judgments of others.\n    - Celebrate your partner’s virtues and acknowledge, but do not dwell, on their faults.\n    - Blame less; remember that nearly all of the annoyances and inconveniences a loving partner causes you are unintended.\n    - Accept more personal responsibility for the setbacks you encounter in your relationships.\n    - Love, all by itself, does not conquer all. Adopt the perspective that successful relationships require creative collaboration, compromise, and effort.\n    - Remember that people behave the way they do around you due in part to the way you behave toward them.\n    - Don’t overestimate your ability to change a potential partner’s negative self-concept.\n    - Don’t get lazy. Continue to work hard to make good impressions on your friends and lovers.\n    - Recognize that you don’t understand your partners as well as you think you do. Actively strive to know and understand them better.\n\n# Lecture\n\n- `PDF`:\n    - [[424 - S2.pdf]]\n- [[Attachment]]\n    - What is attachment?\n        - A long-enduring, emotionally meaningful tie to a particular person\n        -

The net profit or loss from an interaction is its outcome.\n    - *What Do We Expect from Our Relationships*:\n        - People have *comparison levels $CLs$* that reflect their **expectations** for their interactions with others. When the outcomes they receive exceed their CLs, they’re satisfied, but if their outcomes fall below their CLs, they’re discontent.\n    - *How Well Could We Do Elsewhere*:\n        - People also judge the **outcomes** available elsewhere using a comparison level for alternatives $CL_{alt}$. When the outcomes they receive exceed their CL_alt, they can’t do better elsewhere, and they’re dependent on their current partners.\n    - *Four Types of Relationships*:\n        - Comparing people’s $CL$s and $CL_{alt}$s with their outcomes yields four different relationship states: happy and stable; happy and unstable; unhappy and stable; and unhappy and unstable.\n        - \u003cimg src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mel10c/image/main/obsidian/20230123103904.png\" width=\"300\"/\u003e\n    - *$CL$ and $CL_{alt}$ as Time Goes By*:\n        - People adapt to the outcomes they receive, and relationships can become less satisfying as the partners’ CLs rise. Cultural influences shape both our expectations and our CLalt s.\n- The Economies of Relationships\n    - Counting up the rewards and costs of a relationship provides extraordinary information about its current state and likely future.\n    - *Rewards and Costs Are Different*:\n        - An *approach motivation* leads us to seek **rewards**, an *avoidance motivation* leads us to **avoid costs**, and the extent to which each is fulfilled defines different relationship states. ^320b90\n    - *Rewards and Costs as Time Goes By*:\n        - A ==relational turbulence model== suggests that new relationships usually encounter a lull when partners adjust to their new status as an established couple. Thereafter, marital satisfaction usually decreases over the first years of marriage. This may be due to the partners’ lack of effort and to the manner in which interdependency magnifies small irritations, and to other routine influences such as unwelcome surprises and unrealistic expectations. Insight may forestall or prevent these problems.\n- Are We Really This Greedy?\n    - Both the **quality** of outcomes one receives and **underbenefit**, when it occurs, determine how happy and stable a relationship will be.\n    - *The Nature of Interdependency*:\n        - Interdependent partners have a stake in keeping each other happy. As a result, generosity toward one’s partner is often beneficial to oneself.\n    - *Exchange versus Communal Relationships*:\n        - *Exchange* relationships are governed by a desire for immediate repayment of favors\n        - *Communal* relationships involve more selfless concern for another’s needs.\n    - *Equitable Relationships*:\n        - **Equity** occurs when both partners gain benefits from a relationship that are proportional to their contributions to it.\n        - According to ==equity theory==, people dislike inequity. However, overbenefit is not always associated with reduced satisfaction with a relationship—but underbenefit is.\n    - *Some People Are Greedier Than Others*:\n        - *Maximizers* seek to optimize their outcomes; they remain attentive to their alternative options and so are routinely less committed to their current partners than satisficers are.\n- The Nature of Commitment\n    - *Commitment* is a desire to continue a relationship, and the willingness to maintain it. When people are high in commitment readiness, they commit more completely. The investment model asserts that satisfaction, the quality of one’s alternatives, and the size of one’s investments influence commitment. However, there may be three kinds of commitment: **personal, constraint, and moral**.\n    - *The Consequences of Commitment*:\n        - Committed people take action to protect and maintain their relationships, being accommodating, making sacrifices willingly, and derogating others who might lure them away from their relationships.\n\n\n# Lecture\n\n- `PDF`:\n    - [[424 - S3.pdf]]\n- [[Social Cognition]]\n    - Textbook topics\n        - First impressions\n        - Impression management\n        - How well we know our partners\n    - Define social cognition.\n        - Process of _[[perception]]_ and judgment with which one **make sense of the social world**\n    - What is the difference between two type of relationship beliefs (destiny vs growth)?\n        - *Destiny*: no action needed, expect relationships just happens (dysfunctional and disadvantageous)\n        - *Growth*: active action needed to built relationship  (advantages, adaptive)\n    - How is attachment relate to different relationship beliefs as [[Self-fulfilling prophecies]]?\n        - ![[Self-fulfilling prophecies#Anxious/Preoccupied]]\n        - ![[Self-fulfilling prophecies#Fearful]]\n    - How we explain behaviour/events (3 perspectives)\n        - Attribution factors ^a01f82\n            - Internal vs. External\n                - Internal: focus causes of behaviour in personality traits\n                - External: focus cause of behaviour on situational traits\n            - Stable vs unstable\n                - Stable: consistant behaviour\n                - Unstable: inconsistant behaviour\n            - Global vs Specific (controllable vs uncontrollable)\n                - Global: same behaviour in all circumstance (same outcome in all situation)\n                - Specific: different behaviour according to situations\n        - Actor/Observer effect (Fundamental attribution error)\n            - Own behaviour: external cause\n            - Partner's behaviour: internal cause\n        - [[Self Enhancement Bias]] ^6a0606\n            - False uniqueness bias (its' just me)\n            - False consensus (共识) bias: (everyone else does it)\n    - ★ Draw attribution diagram for happy/unhappy relationship ^58de14\n        - ![[Social Cognition#Cognitive Attributions]]\n- [[Social Exchange Theory|Social exchange]] and interdependency\n    - What is social exchange based on?\n        - [[Behaviourism]] principles (rewards and punishment)\n        - [[Economics]]\n    - What did [[social exchange theory]] propose?\n        - All participants in social interactions pursue self-interest by **exchanging** social goods\n        - Assume rational decision on always maximizing reward and minimizing cost\n        - Assume choice is made in ones' **own** interest (self-centred)\n    - What is [[Interdependence theory]] about?\n        - **Interdependence** as the defining feature of any relationship\n        - The extent to which the behaviours of each partner affect the outcomes of the other\n    - What is [[Interdependence theory]] and its 3 key components?\n        1.

In addition, our pupils dilate when we’re seeing something that interests us.\n        - *Body movement*:\n            - Gestures vary widely across cultures, but the posture and motion of the entire body are informative as well.\n        - *Touch*:\n            - Different types of touch have distinctly different meanings.\n        - *Interpersonal distance*:\n            - We use different zones of personal space—the intimate, personal, social, and public zones—for different kinds of interactions.\n        - *Smell*:\n            - Information about one’s emotions is transmitted to others by one’s smell.\n        - *Combining the components*:\n            - Mimicry occurs when people use similar nonverbal behavior without realizing it. Nonverbal actions allow us to fine-tune the intimacy of our interactions in subtle but real ways.\n    - *Nonverbal Sensitivity*:\n        - Unhappy spouses, especially husbands, do a poor job at nonverbal communication.\n- Verbal [[Communication]]\n    - *Self-Disclosure*:\n        - Intimacy involves sharing personal information about oneself to one’s partner.\n        - *How self-disclosure develops*:\n            - As a relationship develops, both the breadth and depth of self-disclosure increase. Intimacy develops when we perceive responsiveness in others that indicates that they understand us and care about us.\n        - *Secrets and other things we don’t want to talk about*:\n            - Couples avoid taboo topics, and some secrecy is routine even in intimate partnerships.\n        - *Self-disclosure and relationship satisfaction*:\n            - Appropriate self-disclosure breeds liking and contentment, and expressions of affection are good for us.\n    - *Gender Differences in Verbal Communication*: ^be93d0\n        - Women are more likely than men to discuss feelings and people, but men and women are equally talkative. However, macho men self-disclose relatively little to other men even when they are friends, and thus are likely to share their most meaningful intimacy only with women.\n- Dysfunctional [[Communication]] and What to Do About It\n    - *Miscommunication*:\n        - Distressed couples have trouble saying what they mean, and they engage in destructive verbal behavior characterized by kitchen-sinking, drifting off-beam, mindreading, interruptions, yes-butting, and cross-complaining. Criticism, contempt, stonewalling, defensiveness, and belligerence are especially corrosive.\n    - *Saying What We Mean*:\n        - Skillful senders use behavior description, I-statements, and XYZ statements to focus on specific actions and make their feelings clear.\n    - *Active Listening*:\n        - Good listeners use paraphrasing and perception checking to u stand their partners.\n    - *Being Polite and Staying Cool*:\n        - Happy couples also avoid extended periods of negative affect reciprocity.\n    - *The Power of Respect and Validation*:\n        - Partners should communicate respect and recognition of the other’s point of view even when they disagree.\n- \u003cu\u003eSuggestions\u003c/u\u003e\n    - Affectionate touching is good for both you and your partner.

Share your hopes, dreams, and fears with trusted, responsive partners.\n    - Ask your partner what they think about the things that are important to you.\n    - Tell those you love that you love them.\n    - When it matters, don’t text.

Paraphrase and check your perceptions of your partner’s meaning.\n    - If you get angry, take a time out. Ask to take a break, go off by yourself, and calm down.\n    - Communicate respect for your partner’s opinions whether or not you agree with them.\n    - Contempt is caustic.

What we are curious about is if **chance is acting alone** or if what we see is due to **chance AND something else.**\n\n- Sometimes statistical inference is not appropriate\n\n  \u003e Ex: if we have data for ALL individuals in the population, there is nothing to *infer*.\n\n- \u003cu\u003eNull hypothesis\u003c/u\u003e - use the notation $H_0$ (said as “aitch naught”), the **default setting**\n\n  - **There is *not enough* evidence against the claim that the defendant is innocent** (Think about the null hypothesis as the ‘boring’ or ‘status quo’ or ‘nothing–going-on-option’)\n- There is **no differences** in...\n  - $H_0:parameter=value$  ($H_0$ is a table, don't put equal marks with it)\n  - \u003cu\u003ep-value\u003c/u\u003e - the probability of observing data that are **at least as unusual** (or **at least as extreme**) as the sample data, *under the assumption that $H_0$ is true* \n    - Estimate it as the proportion of values in the estimated sampling distribution that are as extreme or more extreme than the test statistic calked from the observed sample data\n\n- \u003cu\u003eAlternative hypothesis\u003c/u\u003e - use the notation $H_1$, covers everything that is **not** the value in the null\n\n  - **There is enough evidence against the claim that the defendant is innocent**\n  - There **is a difference** in...\n  - $H_1:paramter\\neq value$\n\n## Steps for Hypothesis Testing (one proportion)\n\n1. State **hypothesis** $H_0$ and $H_1$\n\n2. Calculate a **test statistic** based on the observed sample data\n\n3. Simulate samples under the null hypothesis, and calculate the statistic for each one (estimate **sampling distribution**)\n\n   - Goal: Explore the distribution of values of the statistic if $H_0$ is true. What kind of results are common under the null? What are unusual?\n\n   Simulation: a way to explore random events (use `R`) **(assume $H_0$ is true)**\n\n   - Using `sample()` function that create a sample for the simulation\n\n     ```R\n     simdata \u003c- \u003cdata\u003e %\u003e%\n     \tmutate(\u003cvaraible\u003e = sample(\u003cvariable)) \n     ```\n\n   1. Set values for simulation (sample size, number of repetitions, seed)\n\n      ```R\n      sample(c(\"p1, p2\"),  # vecor with all possible outcomes\n             size = \u003cint\u003e,  # num of values in sample\n             prob = c(\u003cdbl\u003e, \u003cdbl\u003e),  # prob of each outcome (ading to 1)\n      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t# (default is equal to probs)\n             replace = TRUE)  # can outcomes be repeated (default=FALSE)\n      ```\n\n   2. Use a `for` loop to simulate many random samples and calculate the statistic of interest of each one\n\n      ```R\n      set.seed(\u003cint\u003e)  # Set a starting point (make sure its the same across simulation)\n      \n      for (i in 1:\u003cint\u003e)\n      {\n          SOME CODE (loop through sample)\n      }\n      ```\n\n   3. Turn results into a data frame (`tibble()`) so `ggplot` can be used\n\n      ```R\n      \u003cstr\u003e \u003c- tibble(\u003cvariable\u003e = mean(\u003csample\u003e == \"\u003cinterested_condition\u003e\"))\n      ```\n\n   4. Plot the results\n\n      ```R\n      # Dotplot\n      \u003cdata\u003e %\u003e% ggplot(aes(x=\u003cvariable\u003e)) +\n      \tgeom_dotplot() + xlim(0,\u003cint\u003e) + ylim(0,\u003cint\u003e) # \u003cint\u003e is upper limit\n      ```\n\n4. Evaluate the evidence against $H_0$ by calculating the **p-value** (probability of more extreme than observed sample)\n\n   - 2 possible reasons for small p-value\n     1. $H_0$ Is true and the observed case is an *unlikely extreme value* of the statistic\n     2. $H_0$ Is not true\n   - **The smaller the p-value, the more \"evidence\" is against $H_0$, possible reasons**\n   - P-value: all values **great or equal to** ($p + |\\hat{p}-p|$) and all values **less than or equal to** ($p-|\\hat{p}-p|$). This is a **two-sided test** (considers both large and smaller samples)\n\n5.

Randomly divide data into \"training\" and \"testing\" datasets (80% for training, and 20% for testing)\n2. Fit the tree based on the training data only\n3. Run the test through the fitted tree to make predictions, and construct a confusion matrix to see how many are correctly/incorrectly classified\n\n\u003e ##### Example with the `NHANES` dataset\n\u003e ```R\n\u003e NHANES \u003c- NHANES %\u003e% rowid_to_column()  # add a new ID to columm\n\u003e \n\u003e # Find n, the total number of observations\n\u003e n \u003c- nrow(NHANES)\n\u003e \n\u003e # Set training and testing data\n\u003e set.seed(1002)\n\u003e train_ids \u003c- sample(1:n, size= round(0.8*n))\n\u003e \n\u003e train \u003c- NHANES %\u003e% filter(rowid %in% train_ids)\n\u003e test \u003c- NHANES %\u003e% filter(!(rowid %in% train_ids))\n\u003e \n\u003e # Fitting the data\n\u003e tree \u003c- rpart(SleepTrouble ~ SleepHrsNight + DayPhysHlthBad, data=train)\n\u003e plot(as.party(tree), type=\"simple\", gp=gpar(cex=0.8))\n\u003e \n\u003e # Constructing confusion matrix\n\u003e tree_pred \u003c- predict(tree, newdata=test, type=\"class\")\n\u003e table(tree_pred, test$SleepTrouble)\n\u003e ```\n\u003e ```text\n\u003e ##\n\u003e ##\ttree_pred\tNo\t\tYes\n\u003e ##\t\t   No\t339\t\t133\n\u003e ##\t\t  Yes\t9\t\t19\n\u003e ```\n\u003e - Accuracy = $(339 + 19)/(339 + 133 + 9 + 19) = 358/500 = 0.716$\n\u003e - False positive rate = $9 / (339 + 9) = 9/348 = 0.026$\n\u003e - False negative rate = $133 / (133 + 19) = 133/152 = 0.875$ (not so good)\n\n## Comparing different trees\n\n1. Use `rpart()` to specify different sets of candidate predictors to predict the same response\n2. (optional) Plot all trees' visual out with `as.party()`\n3. Constructing confusion matrices for all trees (based on the **testing** data)\n4. Constructing confusion matrices for all trees (based on the **training** data)\n5. Combine the 2 tables above, use it to compare the trees\n    - Understand the priority between accuracy/sensitivity/specificity for the given problem\n        - Ideally all of these should be high, but may have to prioritize one over another \n    - Ideally, prefer the tree to be less complex (less risk of overhitting, more interpretable)\n\n\n## Response variable has more than 2 levels\n- The classification tree method still works\n- The confusion matrix is a $m \\times m$ matrix, where $m$ is the number of levels of the response\n- Sensitivity and specificity does not apply anymore \n- Careful for the different types of possible errors\n\n## Limitations for training and testing approach\n- The accuracy of trees (or RMSE for linear regression models) depends on which observations are in the training/testing sets, which are determined at random\n- Only a single subset of the observations are used to build(or fit) the prediction model\n    - Statistical methods perform better when more data is used to fit them\n    - This approach may make the error rate look a bit worse than it would be if all of the data were used to fit the model (without splitting the training and testing set\u001c) \n","lastmodified":"2023-05-10T19:08:03.578968457Z","tags":["Note"]},"/UofT-Notes/UofT-Notes":{"title":"UofT Notes","content":"\n# ANT100\n\n- [[UofT Notes/ANT100/ANT100: Lecture_1|ANT100: Lecture_1]]\n- [[UofT Notes/ANT100/ANT100: Lecture_1]]\n- [[UofT Notes/ANT100/ANT100: Lecture_2]]\n- [[UofT Notes/ANT100/ANT100: Lecture_3\u00264]]\n- [[UofT Notes/ANT100/ANT100: Lecture_5\u00266]]\n- [[UofT Notes/ANT100/ANT100: Lecture_7]]\n- [[UofT Notes/ANT100/ANT100: Lecture_8]]\n- [[UofT Notes/ANT100/ANT100: Lecture_9\u002611]]\n- [[UofT Notes/ANT100/ANT100: Lecture_12]]\n- [[UofT Notes/ANT100/ANT100: Lecture_13]]\n- [[UofT Notes/ANT100/ANT100: Lecture_14]]\n- [[UofT Notes/ANT100/ANT100: Lecture_15]]\n- [[UofT Notes/ANT100/ANT100: Lecture_16]]\n- [[UofT Notes/ANT100/ANT100: Lecture_17]]\n- [[UofT Notes/ANT100/ANT100: Lecture_18]]\n- [[UofT Notes/ANT100/ANT100: Lecture_19]]\n- [[UofT Notes/ANT100/ANT100: Lecture_20]]\n- [[UofT Notes/ANT100/ANT100: Lecture_21]]\n- [[UofT Notes/ANT100/ANT100: Lecture_22]]\n- [[UofT Notes/ANT100/ANT100: Lecture_23]]\n- [[UofT Notes/ANT100/ANT100: Lecture_24]]\n- [[UofT Notes/ANT100/ANT100: Lecture_25]]\n- [[UofT Notes/ANT100/ANT100: Lecture_26]]\n\n# CSC111\n\n- [[UofT Notes/CSC111/CSC111: 1_Linked Lists]]\n- [[UofT Notes/CSC111/CSC111: 2_Induction and Recursion]]\n- [[UofT Notes/CSC111/CSC111: 3_Trees]]\n- [[UofT Notes/CSC111/CSC111: 4_Binary Search Trees]]\n- [[UofT Notes/CSC111/CSC111: 5_Abstract Syntax Trees]]\n- [[UofT Notes/CSC111/CSC111: 6_Graph Class]]\n- [[UofT Notes/CSC111/CSC111: 7_Graphs in Python]]\n- [[UofT Notes/CSC111/CSC111: 8_Cycles and Trees]]\n- [[UofT Notes/CSC111/CSC111: 9_Computing Spanning Tree]]\n- [[UofT Notes/CSC111/CSC111: 10_Selection and Insertion]]\n- [[UofT Notes/CSC111/CSC111: 11_Divide-and-Conquer]]\n- [[UofT Notes/CSC111/CSC111: 12_Average-Case Running Time]]\n\n# MAT223\n\n- [[UofT Notes/MAT223/MAT223: 1_Sets and Vectors]]\n- [[UofT Notes/MAT223/MAT223: 2_Vector, Lines, and Planes]]\n- [[UofT Notes/MAT223/MAT223: 3_Linear Dependence]]\n- [[UofT Notes/MAT223/MAT223: 4_Dot Products \u0026 Normal]]\n- [[UofT Notes/MAT223/MAT223: 5_Projections]]\n- [[UofT Notes/MAT223/MAT223: 6_Subspaces]]\n- [[UofT Notes/MAT223/MAT223: 7_Matrix]]\n- [[UofT Notes/MAT223/MAT223: 8_Change of Basis]]\n- [[UofT Notes/MAT223/MAT223: 9\u002610_Linear Transformations]]\n- [[UofT Notes/MAT223/MAT223: 11_Range \u0026 Nullspace]]\n- [[UofT Notes/MAT223/MAT223: 12_Inverse Functions and Matrices]]\n- [[UofT Notes/MAT223/MAT223: 13\u002614_Change of Basis II and Determinations]]\n- [[UofT Notes/MAT223/MAT223: 15\u002616_Eigenvectors and Diagonalization]]\n\n# MGT100\n\n- [[UofT Notes/MAT100/MGT100: -

From Infant to Adulthood","content":"\n### Process of Attachment Formation\n\nAttachment is a strong, meaningful, emotional bond one forms with another to establish secure bases in this infinite, chaotic, and cold universe. Research have suggested that infants has a biological bias to form such a bond with its primary caregivers (Bowlby, 1969)[^1]. Throughout evolutionary periods, such bias was proven successful for increasing the infant's likelihood to survive. However, in the modern era with time as a scarce resource, child-caring is not the only task for many caregivers, thus many parents has neglected the opportunity to form such bond with its child. Like trees without a secure root, children without such bonding would be especially vulnerable in any relationships going into adulthood. Some of this vulnerability might suggest inability or low desire to form any intimate relationships, others might suggest inappropriate behaviors that might harm themselves or their potential partners. This article will discuss the formation of such problematic attachments and some strategies for insecure adults to improve.\n\nWhen an infant start to interact with another person in this world, an inborn, unconscious program starts to operate to help the child understand and interpret such interactions, this is called an Attachment Behavioral System, or *ABS* for short (Cassidy, 2013)[^2]. At first, the *ABS*  tries to actively seek intimacy with their attachment figures as its primary strategy to form bonds. This intimacy seeking behaviour can manifest in an infant as crying or shouting for attention when they needed it. After such active behaviour, the system starts to unconsciously monitor the feedback/presence from its attachment figures. If their active behaviour had resulted in wanted attention/solution, the *ABS* would learn such [[association]] and stored it in an Internal Working Model (`IWM`s)[^3]. The `IWM`s are like the primary bookshelf in everyone's cognition, each schema is like an instruction book on the bookshelf. Relationship schemas is one of those instruction books, each represents some expectations of others and senses of oneself. Importantly, these \"instruction books\" will remain and being carried into one's adulthood. This would suggest that every interaction, good or bad,  between infants and its attachment figures will leave a small but noticeable trace in the books on the bookshelf.\n\n### Attachment Types\n\n`ABS ----[Feedback]--\u003e IMW ----[Repetition]--\u003e Attachment Type`\n\nWith this concept in mind, lets examine the cognition process from the *ABS*  to the `IWM`s  and consistent activation between them forms different attachment types that people are familiar with.\n\nFor example, when an infant first start to use the preset primary strategy to seek intimacy with their attachment figure, consistent positive feedback would indicate success for this strategy. Thus, this would lead to an unconscious sense of security in the `IWM`s, which further result in the **secure attachment types**. In this case, the \"instruction\" books have suggested expecting positive feedback from others with a positive, secure, and consistent sense of self.\n\nSo, what if the infant did not get the attention/solution they wanted by using the primary intimacy seeking strategy? Research have suggested two alternative ways in the *ABS* [^2]. One of such way is to start acting hyperactively. Meaning, the infant would try to cry louder to seek attention and intimacy. Reasonably, some parent would start to react to them. However, this means that the infants would always try to cry harder and hope that in some occasion the parents would finally react to their needs. This inconsistent feedback from the attachment figures would result in  a sense of insecurity and inconsistency in the `IWM`s. Repeated activation of hyper-activation and insecurity would gradually result in an **anxious attachment type** in the child. This would suggest the child has an anxious/unsure expectation for other's response, thus leading to an insecure and inconsistent sense of self.\n\nOn the other hand, another strategy the infant could adapt when the primary strategy failed is to decrease their action for intimacy seeking. Meaning, the infant would stop to cry to seek attention/intimacy. Instead, they tried to unconsciously suppress their need to belong to justify the absence of feedback from their attachment figures. Long term suppression would then be stored in the \"instruction books\" in the `IWM`s with low expectation for feedback and insecure sense of self. Repeated long term use of the of deactivation strategy and consistent low feedback would then lead to the **avoidant attachment type** in the child.\n\nLastly, there also exist an extreme case where all of the above strategy did not work for the infant. This often correlates with some form of childhood trauma, resulting in a complete break-down of the child's `IWM`s. Leading to a **fearful attachment type**. However, for simplicity of this article, this case will not be discussed in depth. Further readings can be found in the reference.\n\n### Leading to Adulthood\n\nAs mentioned before, these schemas (\"instruction books\") in the `IWM`s would be carried into adulthood, as expectations for romantic partners and sense of self as an individual. Evidence from empirical research suggested the correlation between the three childhood attachment types with the three romantic relationship models: autonomous, dismissing, and preoccupied (Main et al, 1985) [^4]. The autonomous attachment model has a consistent, positive expectation for their partners, and a secure sense of self, correlating with the secure attachment type in children; the dismissing model suggest a consistent, but negative/inattentive expectation for their partners, and an insecure sense of self, correlating with the avoidant attachment types in children; lastly the preoccupied model would suggest an inconsistent expectation for their partners and an insecure sense of self, correlating with the anxious attachment type in children.\n\nNonetheless, it is important to note that these correlation does not suggest a causation relationship between childhood attachment and adulthood romantic attachments. Research have suggested that auld attachment is more variable and changeable with experience (Bartholomew,1990) [^5]. In other words, adult attachments are much more complex and rely less on the biological bases than the childhood attachments. This suggestion implied the possibility to change the adult attachment types by dismissing negative or re-establishing a positive sense of self in the `IWM`s with strategies such as CBT (Cognitive Behaviour Therapy). CBT could also help to adjust negative expectations toward potential partners and work toward a more long-lasting relationship.\n\n[^1]: Bowlby, J., 1969.

For school-age children and adults, there are difficulties in learning academic skills involving reading, writing, arith- metic, time, or money, with support needed in one or more areas to meet age-related expectations. In adults, abstract thinking, executive function (i.e., planning, strategizing, priority setting, and cognitive flexibility), and short-term memory, as well as func- tional use of academic skills (e.g., reading, money management), are impaired. There is a somewhat con- crete approach to problems and solu- tions compared with age-mates.</td><td>Compared with typically developing agemates, the individual is immature in social interactions. For example, there may be difficulty in accurately perceiving peers&rsquo; social cues. Com- munication, conversation, and lan- guage are more concrete or immature than expected for age. There may be difficulties regulating emotion and behavior in age-appropriate fashion; these difficulties are noticed by peers in social situations. There is limited understanding of risk in social situa- tions; social judgment is immature for age, and the person is at risk of being manipulated by others (gullibility).</td><td>The individual may function age- appropriately in personal care. Individ- uals need some support with complex daily living tasks in comparison to peers. In adulthood, supports typically involve grocery shopping, transporta- tion, home and child-care organiz- ing, nutritious food preparation, and banking and money management. Recreational skills resemble those of age-mates, although judgment related to well-being and organization around recreation requires support. In adult- hood, competitive employment is often seen in jobs that do not empha- size conceptual skills. Individuals generally need support to make health care decisions and legal decisions, and to learn to perform a skilled voca- tion competently. Support is typically needed to raise a family.</td></tr><tr><td>Moderate</td><td>All through development, the indi- vidual&rsquo;s conceptual skills lag markedly behind those of peers. For preschool- ers, language and pre-academic skills develop slowly. For school-age children, progress in reading, writing, mathematics, and understanding of time and money occurs slowly across the school years and is markedly lim- ited compared with that of peers. For adults, academic skill development is typically at an elementary level, and support is required for all use of aca- demic skills in work and personal life. Ongoing assistance on a daily basis is needed to complete conceptual tasks of day-to-day life, and others may take over these responsibilities fully for the individual.</td><td>The individual shows marked dif- ferences from peers in social and communicative behavior across development. Spoken language is typically a primary tool for social com- munication but is much less complex than that of peers. Capacity for rela- tionships is evident in ties to family and friends, and the individual may have successful friendships across life and sometimes romantic relations in adulthood. However, individuals may not perceive or interpret social cues accurately. Social judgment and decision-making abilities are limited; and caretakers must assist the person with life decisions. Friendships with typically developing peers are often affected by communication or social limitations. Significant social and communicative support is needed in work settings&rsquo; for success.</td><td>The individual can care for personal needs involving eating, dressing, elimination, and hygiene as an adult, although an extended period of teaching and time is needed for the individual to become independent in these areas, and reminders may be needed. Similarly, participation in all household tasks can be achieved by adulthood, although an extended period of teaching is needed, and ongoing supports will typically occur for adult-level performance. Inde- pendent employment in jobs that require limited conceptual and com- munication skills can be achieved, but considerable support from co-workers, supervisors, and others is needed to manage social expectations, job com- plexities, and ancillary responsibilities such as scheduling, transportation, health benefits, and money manage- ment. A variety of recreational skills can be developed. These typically require additional supports and learn- ing opportunities over an extended period of time. Maladaptive behavior is present in a significant minority and causes social problems.</td></tr><tr><td>Severe</td><td>Attainment of conceptual skills is limited. This individual generally has little understanding of written language or of concepts involving numbers, quantity, time, and money. Caretakers provide extensive supports for problem solving throughout life</td><td>Spoken language is quite limited in terms of vocabulary and grammar. Speech may be single words or phrases and may be supplemented through augmentative means. Speech and communication are focused on the here and now within everyday events. Language is used for social communication more than for explication. Individuals understand simple speech and gestural communication. Relationships with family members and familiar others are a source of pleasure and help</td><td>The individual requires support for all activities of daily living, including meals, dressing, bathing, and elimination. The individual requires supervision at all times. The individual cannot make responsible decisions regarding well-being of self or others. In adulthood, participation in tasks at home, recreation, and work requires ongoing support and assistance. Skill acquisition in all domains involves long-term teaching and ongoing support. Maladaptive behavior, including self-injury, is present in a significant minority.</td></tr><tr><td>Profound</td><td>Conceptual skills generally involve the physical world rather than symbolic processes. The individual may use objects in goal-directed fashion for self-care, work, and recreation. Certain visuospatial skills, such as matching and sorting based on physical characteristics, may be acquired. However, co-occurring motor and sensory impairments may prevent functional use of objects.</td><td>The individual has very limited understanding of symbolic communication in speech or gesture. He or she may understand some simple instructions or gestures. The individual expresses his or her own desires and emotions largely through nonverbal, nonsymbolic communication. The individual enjoys relationships with well-known family members, caretakers, and familiar other, and initiates and responds to social interactions through gestural and emotional cues. Co-occurring sensory and physical impairments may prevent many social activities.</td><td>The individual is dependent on others for all aspects of daily physical care, health, and safety, although he or she may be able to participate in some of these activities as well. Individuals without severe physical impairments may assist with some daily work tasks at home, like carrying dishes to the table. Simple actions with objects may be the basis of participation in some vocational activities with high levels of ongoing support. Recreational activities may involve, for example, enjoyment in listening to music, watching movies, going out for walks, or participating in water activities, all with the support of others. Co-occurring physical and sensory impairments are frequent barriers to participation (beyond watching) in home, recreational, and vocational activities. Maladaptive behavior is present in a significant minority.</td></tr></tbody></table></li></ul></li></ul><a href=#etiology><h2 id=etiology><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Etiology</h2></a><ul><li><code>Zigler's Two-Group Appraoch</code><ul><li>Organic group: a clear <strong>biological basis</strong> (severe and profound ID)<ul><li>Genetic disorders</li><li>Chromosome abnormalities</li><li>Behavioural phenotypes</li></ul></li><li>Cultural-familial group: no clear organic basis (mild ID)</li></ul></li></ul><a href=#genetic-inheritance><h3 id=genetic-inheritance><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Genetic Inheritance</h3></a><ol><li>Dominat inheritance cause (Tuberous sclerosis and neurofibromatosis)</li><li>Recessive inheritance cause (Phenylketonuria)</li><li>Sex-linked (<a href=/PKM/Psychology/Disorders/Fragile-X-syndrome rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/PKM/Psychology/Disorders/Fragile-X-syndrome>Fragile X syndrome</a> and Lesch-Nyah syndrome)</li></ol><a href=#chromosomal-abnormalities><h3 id=chromosomal-abnormalities><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chromosomal Abnormalities</h3></a><ul><li>Occurs at conception</li><li><a href=/PKM/Psychology/Disorders/Down-syndrome rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/PKM/Psychology/Disorders/Down-syndrome>Down syndrome</a></li></ul><a href=#metabolic-disorders><h3 id=metabolic-disorders><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Metabolic Disorders</h3></a><ul><li>Ex.

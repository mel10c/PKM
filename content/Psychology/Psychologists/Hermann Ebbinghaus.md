**The father of modern memory research.**

# About him

- A  contemporary of [[William James]]
- Unable to afford to pay anyone to participate in his research, he did his studies using himself as the only test participant.

# Significant Contributions

- *Retention curve*: which measures how much information is retained at each point in time following learning
	- Illustrates that most forgetting occurs early on: if a memory can survive the first few hours after learning, there is little additional forgetting

### Memory Models

1. Learn the list (form new memory)
2. Delay
3. Test for memory
4. Relearn the same list
- <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4e/ForgettingCurve.svg" width="300">
- Dependent variable: *savings* ($1 - \text{time to learn list second time} / \text{time to learn first time}$)
	- Higher savings (value of 1) -> good memory
	- 0 savings -> list completely forgotten
- *Exponential forgetting Curve*: rapid initial forgetting, but progressively less forgetting with time

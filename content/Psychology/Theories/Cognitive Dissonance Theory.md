==Cognitive Dissonance==

**`Attitudes vs. Behavior => unpleasant feeling => efforts to resolve`** ^56d30e

---

# Detail

- Focus on the inconsistencies between thoughts feelings, and behavior that can create unpleasant mental states (cognitive dissonance) that **motives mental efforts to resolve them**
- When behavior is hard to change, people would then revert to change their attitude so they feel bad. This would make them to enter the **denial** mode. So they would react like

1. Change the thought
2. Change the behavior
3. Rationalizing (add another thought)
    - Smoking is bad, I smoke, but I also act health on other aspects, so it should be fine.
4. Trivialize the inconsistency (don't care)

# Application

> When parent bought you a new fancy car, but it its bad for the environment.

1. `Want to protect enviroment => Leave car at home, ride bike to school => Consonance`
    - Creates **consonance** with consistency, no pressure to change

2. `Want to protect enviroment => Drive car everyday => Dissonance`
    - Creates **dissonance** with inconsistency, create pressure to change

<u>SINCE</u>: Changing the **behavior** is harder then changing the **attitude** about environments.

<u>THUS</u>: *Rationalizing*: believe that driving the car is not so bad for the environment.

# Thoughts

- I believe this is a very big part of your internal struggle. Your thoughts are always high and up there, but your actions stops too quickly. Thus dissonance occur.
	- [[Attitudes#Effort Justification]]'s solution is more like the [[Absurdism]]'s philosophy. Leave in the present, image yourself happy, make meaning from the given presence.

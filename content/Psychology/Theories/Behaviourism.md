==Behaviourism==

- **Systematic approach to understanding the behaviour of humans and other animals**

---

# Detail

- **Focus on Behaviour**: Behaviour is observable, objective, and quantifiable; mental processes such as dreams, feelings, and the subconscious are not directly observable and therefore canâ€™t be studied scientifically
- [[Empiricism]]: Behaviour is shaped by experience and can be controlled by regulating experience
- Evolutionary Perspective: Humans are basically the same as any other animal; what works for a rat will work for a human
- **Quantitative**: Like physicists, try to identify basic mathematical laws that will generalize to many behaviours
- [[Law of Effect]]: Our behaviour is not shaped by the subconscious but by past experience; we seek to repeat rewards and avoid punishments

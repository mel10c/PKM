==Social Comparison Theory==

- **People evaluate themselves through comparisons to others** ^833134

---

# Detail

- There is a drive within individuals to gain accurate **self-evaluations**
    - By comparing to others, they can reduce uncertainty and learn their self definition
    - Self comparison as a way of [[Social Self#Self Knowledge|self enhancement]]
- *Downward comparison* (compare to people "worse" than you)
  - Pro: Fails to provide information on how to improve
  - Con: Boosts self-esteem
- *Upward comparison* (compare to people "better" than you)
  - Pro: Makes people feel bad about themselves
  - Con: Motivates self improvement

# Thoughts

- Difference between [[Sociometer Hypothesis]]:
    - Sociometer hypothesis focuses more on the defining self worth and [[Social Self#Self Esteem|self esteem]]
    - Social comparison theory focuses more on [[Social Self#Self Knowledge|self enhancement]]
- The popularity of **social media** increased the comparison exposure
	- I think this over-exposure has a more negative effect than the positive outcomes. 
	- Individuals start to compare themselves to the people outside of their social circle and hierarchy, these **upward comparison is a important stress factor** in modern society

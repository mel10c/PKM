==Structuralism==

- **Study the elements of psychological experiences using *analytic introspection***

---

# Detail

-   Ideas of **experimentation**
    -   _Analytic introspection_: observation of internal event
    -   Describe their own internal conscious experience in a trained and **controlled** shape
    -   Descriptions needed to be **replicated** by independent participants
-   Ideas of **attention**
    -   First to differentiate _focused attention_ and _divided attention_ (didn't call this)
    -   Much of brain activity is outside of awareness (ex. cortical blindness)
-   Ideas of **memory**
    -   First to discovery the magic 7±2 capacity of memory (didn't take credit)
-   Ideas of **language**
    -   First to use tree diagrams to represent language
- Identified differences between [[Sensation]] + [[Perception]] (seeing is different than feeling)
- Suggested that **unconscious processes** (which cannot be revealed by introspection) accompany behaviour

# Thoughts

- [[Bottom-up]] philosophy, believes small things together makes up the big thing. Thus, the whole picture can be and should be break down and understood by small pieces
	- I do not fully agree. I believe that big structure is the essential part, small parts and produce of the big structure. Thus focus on the small pieces is easy to get carried away

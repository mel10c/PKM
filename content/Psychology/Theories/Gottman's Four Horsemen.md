    - Antidotes: complain without blame (focus on specific behavior)
2. *Defensiveness*
    - Warding off criticism through counter attack (blaming their partner)
    - Antidotes: accept responsibility 
3. *Contempt*
    - Speaking "down" to their partner (superiority)
    - Greatest predictor of divorce
    - Antidotes: build a culture of appreciation and respect (don't contempt)
4. *Stonewalling*
    - Ignoring or shutting out the partner (withdrawing)
    - Antidotes: practice physiological self-soothing (I need to take a moment)

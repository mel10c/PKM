==Psychophysics==

- **The science of defining *quantitative relationships* between physical (external stimuli) & psychological (sensation and perception) events**
-   What can be measured & How can it be measured

---

# Detail

- *Absolute threshold*: min amount of stimulation for a person to detect a stimulus $50\%$ of the time
- *Two-point touch threshold*: min distance for two stimuli to be distinguishable ^e7dd5f
- *JND*: just noticeable difference (difference threshold): the smallest detectable difference between two stimuli OR min change can be be correctly judged as difference ^695e9b
- *Weber's Law*: as stimulus intensity grows, larger changes are needed to be detectable: 
- [[Signal Detection Theory]]

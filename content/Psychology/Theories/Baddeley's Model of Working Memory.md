- *Phonological Loop*: acoustic/verbal information
    - Phonological store
    - Articulatory rehearsal process (allow info to convert from visual to verbal)
- *Central Executive*: considered an [[Attention|attentional]] control mechanism;
    - Does not have any storage capacity
    - Regulating relevant and irrelevant information
- *Sketchpad*: object/location information
    - Visual information store and manipulation
    - Has individual storage of working memory, does not interfere with processes of the phonological loop

# Evidence

- Articulatory suppression: disupts recall; reduces (or eliminates) [[#^476ddc|phonological similarity effect]] and [[#^6b6dac|word length effect]]

==Classical Conditioning==

- **A behavioral procedure in which a *biologically potent stimulus* is paired with a previously *neutral stimulus* to produce a *response* through [[Learning]]**

- Connect to [[law of Association]]
	- Frequency: strengthen association through **learning curve**
	- Contiguity: stimuli will be **extinguished** when none present
	- Similarity: stimuli can be **generalized**
- Account for the development of strong emotions in response to certain specific objects

## Rules of Interest

### Timing

<img src="https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/008vxvgGgy1h7jlawclatj312u0mqq5d.jpg" width="300">

- **Shorter timing** between US and CS `->` **better** learning (*delay* conditioning)
- **Longer interstimulus intervals (ISIs)**, `->` **worser** learning (*trace* conditioning)
- US then CS `->` no learning (*backwards* conditioning)

### Blocking

- Experiment
    - | Group                             | Phase 1                          | Phase 2                                 | Phase 3 (test)                                   |
    | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
    | Control group                     | Rat sits in chamber; no training | Tone CS combined with light CS shock US | Tone CS or light CS: medium CR                   |
    | Experimental "pretrained" " group | Light CS shock US                | Tone CS combined with light CS shock US | Tone CS: little or no CR (learning is "**blocked**") |
    - <u>Control group</u>:
        - Trained to tone+light CS preceding shock US
        - Afterward, **both** tone and light produce modest CRs (freezing)
    - <u>Pre-trained</u> group:
        - Pre-trained with light CS preceding shock US
        - Then **same** tone+light CS training as in the control group
        - Afterward, light produced large CR and **tone** produced **none**
- Prior experience with the light+US association **blocks** learning of the tone+US association
- When the CS is redundant to what is known, no learning occurs

### Latent inhibition

1. Pre-expose to CS repeatedly
2. Then pair CS with US
3. Learning is **inhibited**
- Animal has learned that the CS is **useless**, has stopped “paying attention”

### Associative Bias

- Some associations are innately easier to make
    - When tone + taste paired with poison, only taste provokes CR
    - When tone + taste paired with shock, only tone provokes CR
- Humans have some **innate preferences** for forming associations that can override statistical correlations

## Models

- ==Mackintosh Model==
    - Focused on **attention**, and the way the CS is processed
        - Learning changes processing of the CS
    1. Stimuli have a salience that determines attention
    2. Repeated exposure with no consequences decreases salience (attention), a form of [[habituation]]
    3. In [[Classical Conditioning#Latent inhibition|latent inhibition]] , pre-exposure to the CS decreases attention for that stimulus, making it harder to learn about in the training phase

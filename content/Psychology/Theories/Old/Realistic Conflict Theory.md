==Realistic Conflict Theory (RCT)==

- **Explains how intergroup hostility can arise as a result of conflicting goals and competition over limited resources**

---

# Detail

- Prejudice results from different social groups competing over scarce resources (Ex. land)
- Those who tend to **lose the most** tend to be the most prejudice

# Application

> Ex. America building the wall
> The poorest American would likely be the ones that are most wanting the wall to be built to stop the Mexicans from owning their land, job, resources...

# Reference
> Supportive research: [[Robbers Cave Study]]

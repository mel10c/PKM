==Operant Conditioning==

- **A type of associative [[Learning]] process through which the strength of a behavior is modified by *reinforcement* or *punishment***

---

# Detail

$$ S \quad \longrightarrow \quad R \quad \longrightarrow \quad O$$
- `S` *Discriminative Stimulus*: distinguishes which contingencies are in effect ^d44efc
    - Crucial in this type of learning
- `R` *Response*
- `O` *Outcome*:
    - |                        | *Punishment* (decreasing behavior)           | *Reinforcement* (increasing behavior)        |
    | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
    | **Positive** (adding)      | Adding Undesired  `->` Decrease behaviour     | Adding Desired `->` Increase Behaviour      |
    | **Negative** (subtracting) | Taking Desired  `->` Decrease Behaviour | Taking Undesired `->` Increase Behaviour |
- Application with [[Law of Effect]]
- Effectiveness of conditioning:  `Timing + Relationship` between behaviour and consequence
    - Closer in time behaviour and consequence, better the learning
- ==Method==: [[Skinner's Box]]

## Type of Conditioning

- *Shaping*: through successive approximation builds a complex `R` incrementally
    - Initially, contingency is introduced for simple behaviour, `R `
    - As rate of `R` improves, contingency is **moved to a more complex version** of `R`
    - Gradually builds a complex `R` animal would never spontaneously produce
- *Chaining*: builds complex `R` sequences by **linking together** `S->R->O` condition
    - Initially, train animal to pick up object
    - Next, reward for picking up and then throwing it
    - Allows **series of behaviours** (as opposed to shaping, which simply **elaborates on a single response**)

## Reinforcer

- *Primary reinforcer*: A reinforcer, such as food, water, or sleep, that is of biological value to an organism
    - [[Drive Reduction Theory]]
    - *Negative contrast*: The phenomenon in which the reinforcing value of one reward is reduced because a better reward is expected
- *Secondary reinforcer*: A reinforcer that initially has no biological value but that has been [[Classical Conditioning|paired with]] (or predicts the arrival of) a primary reinforcer
    - Ex. Money, Grade, Token
    - *Token economy*: An environment (such as a prison or schoolroom) in which tokens function the same way as money does in the outside world.

## Punishment

- *Punisher* is an outcome that decreases the frequency of the behaviour
- Punishment or generalized suppression
    - Punishment can become **less effective** with time, with `R`s creeping back up to non-punished levels
    - Proposed that punishment **does not produce true operant conditioning** (true learning of a contingency)
    - Instead produces generalized suppression, a temporary decrease in most behaviours
- Hard to train
    - Circumvention â€“ animal may learn discriminative stimuli that help it avoid punishment
    - Can produce fear/anxiety/rage that can impair behaviour
    - Can produce generalized behaviour disruptions
    - Can produce aggression
- Discriminative stimuli can enable **cheating** ^506d14
    - For effective punishment, contingency should always be in effect

## Schedule

| Schedule | Details |
|---------|----------------------|

| <img src="https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/008vxvgGgy1h7k3o6m09uj30sa0mqgn9.jpg" width="300"> | **Fixed Ratio (FR)** (blue) [Ex. every chords, gain 1 dollar] <br> Every $X$ `R`s produces $1$ `O` <br> Higher ratio, longer pause after each reward <br> Steady responding (upward line) until reinforcement <br> <u>Post-reinforcement pause</u>: (flat line): time out from responding after each reward <br> **Variable Ratio (VR)** (green) [Ex. Gambling] <br> Every $X$ `R`s produces $1$ `O`; BUT $X$ changes with each reinforce <br> Constant and high rate of responding |
|<img src="https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/008vxvgGgy1h7k3oc96xdj30r00mmabo.jpg" width="300"> | **Fixed Interval(FI)** (blue) [Ex. Weekly paycheck] <br> Every $Y$ `sec`s $1$ `R` produces $1$ `O` <br> At beginning of interval, little/no responding (Scallop) <br> Increases to rapid rate of responding before interval expiration  <br> **Variable Interval (VI)** (green) [Ex. Pop Quiz] <br> Every $Y$ `sec`s $1$ `R` produces $1$ `O`; $Y$ changes after each `O` <br> Steady but low rate of responding |

- ==Matching law of choice behaviour==: response rates to concurrent VI schedules often correspond to the rate of reinforcement for each schedule

==Psychoanalysis Theory==

- **A theory strategy based on [[Psychodynamic Perspective]]**

---

# Detail
## Other Branches

- First branch: [[Sigmund Freud]] & [[Carl Jung]] based on **will to pleasure**
- Second branch: [[Alfred Alder]] based on **will to power**
	- People always feel sense of inferiority, overcome by strive to superiority
- Third branch: [[Viktor Frankl]] based on **will to meaning**



## Assumptions of the Psychoanalytic Approach

1. *Psychic determinism*: Everything happens in mind has a specific cause ([[P&T - Chapter 1#Core Assumption|psychic causality]]) ^8e3b00
2. *Internal Structure*: The 3 parts of the brain ([[#Structure of the mind|ID, EGO, SUPEREGO]])
3. *Psychic conflict*: The [[#Defense Mechanism|conflict]] between the 3 structures of the brain (SUPEREGO vs ID, EGO mediate)
4. *Mental energy*: One have a finite amount of energy that needed [[#Categories of instincts|control]]


# Psychoanalysis

##### Psychoanalysis
> ------------------------------------------------------------
> System of psychotherapy that focuses on **uncovering the unconscious** material responsible for a patient's disorder
>
> ------------------------------------------------------------

### Contrbutions to Modern Field

- Focus on early mother-infant relationship (lead to [[Attachment Theory]])
- Gender roles has both biological and relationship contributions
- Aggression is a basic biological drive
- Unconscious thoughts and motives under stereotyping

### Psychosexual Stage Model

> Early in life there are developmental stages, each with its **unique challenges** and a mode of **sexual gratification**
>
> `Oral ==> Anal => Oedipal/Phallic => Latency => Genital`

- Frustration or over gratification during a particular stage would result in "fixation", and develop corresponding personalities along with it
    - *Oral fixation*: resulting a dependent personality
    - *Anal fixation*: result in a lifelong preoccupation with control
    - *Oedipal fixation*: result to aggressive, competitive personality orientation

### Structure of the mind

- Level of consciousness: *Unconscious*, *preconscious*, *conscious*
- Structural model
    - ID - actions based on the **pleasure principle** and wish fulfillment
    - EGO - satisfies ID impulses, but takes into consideration the **realities** of the world
    - SUPEREGO - represents **society's values** and standards
    - <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/be/Structural-Iceberg.svg/1200px-Structural-Iceberg.svg.png" alt="" width="200">


### Defense Mechanism


- *Repression*: active effort by the EGO to push threatening material out of consciousness
- *Sublimation*: channelling threatening unconscious impulses into socially acceptable actions (healthy)
- *Displacement*: channelling impulses to nonthreatening objects
- *Denial*: refusal to accept that certain fact exist (consciously known)
- *Reaction formation*: acting in a manner opposite to threatening unconscious desires
- *Intellectualization*: removal of emotional content from the thought, helps bring difficult thoughts into consciousness without anxiety
    - Focus deep into dealing with the problem, block emotion
- *Projection*: attributing unconscious impulse to other people
### Free Association

^b38c3e

> Most famous

- Inspired by the talking cure with Anna O
- Allow clients to freely talk during conversations
- Using their **wordings and associations** to unpack their unconscious

### Dream Interpretation

- Argues that there are **universal symbols** in human's dream that can reveal things about their unconscious

### Language and Symbolic behavior

- Argues that people sometimes didn't mean to saying something, but nonetheless reveals their unconscious
- **Freudian slip**

- *Social loafing* - the tendency to exert less effort when working on a group where individual contributions cannot **not be monitored**
- *Deindividuation* - the reduced sense of individual identity ans self control that occurs in large groups (**impulsivity, irrationality, emotionality, antisociality**)
    * Individuation - enhanced individual identity produced by focusing attention of the self
    * [[乌合之众]]

## Zajonc's Model

> Do we behave better when others are present?

> `Others presence => Arousal => Strengthens dominant responses`
> - Dominant response is *correct* (enhance easy behavior)
> - Dominant response is *incorrect* (impairing difficult behavior)
- This implies that when there are mere presence of others, **people do better or simple or well-learned tasks, and worse for difficult or novel tasks**

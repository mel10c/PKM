## Strategies

> [[Power Law of Learning]]

### Quality Feedback

- *Feedback*: gain knowledge of results during training â€”an indication of how well you are performing the skill
- `Study`: Line drawing experiment by [[Edward Thorndike]]
- **Frequency** of feedback is also important
    - Frequent feedback `->` helpful initially, worse long-term performance
    - Infrequent feedback `->` slower start, better long-term performance

### Spaced Repetition

- Spaced practice is much more effective

### Varied Practice

- *Constant practice*: focused on a single skill
    - **Sometimes good**: it is still unclear how to pick the best practice schedule for a specific skill
- *Variable practice*: alternates between a set of skills
    - **Often more effective**

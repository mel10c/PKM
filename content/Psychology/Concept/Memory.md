- ==Types==
    - [[Sensory Memory]]
    - [[Short Term Memory]] & [[Working Memory]]
    - [[Long Term Memory]]
    - Distinctions
        - | STM                              | LTM                            |
        | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
        | Active contents of **consciousness** | Not currently in consciousness |
        | Rapidly **accessed**                 | Accessed more slowly           |
        | **Limited** in capacity              | Unlimited in capacity          |
        | **Forgotten** quickly                | Forgotten more slowly          |
- *Memory Code*: how is information coded and stored?
- *Limiting Factors*: capacity & duration
- [[Memory Processes]] that allow information to enter and exit memory
- Evidence suggested a double-dissociation between long-term and short-term memory

## Theories

- [[Atkinson–Shiffrin Memory Model]]

### Associative Model 

- Memories are **networks** of associations, with similar memories sharing key elements in common.
- Proposed that these links would be physically formed in the brain (false)

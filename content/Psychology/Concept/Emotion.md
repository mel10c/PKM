### James-Lange Theory

- ==James-Lange Theory== The theory that conscious feelings of emotion occur when the mind senses the physiological responses associated with fear or some other kind of arousal
- ==Somatic theories of emotion== Theories of emotion based on the central premise that physiological responses to stimuli come first, and these determine or induce emotions.

### Cannon-Bard Theory

- The theory that conscious feelings of emotion and bodily responses (physiological responses and overt behaviors) occur simultaneously and independently.

### Two-factor theory

- The theory that a **combination** of cognitive appraisal and perception of biological changes **together** determines our conscious feelings of emotion.

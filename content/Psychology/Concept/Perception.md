	3. Transduction into neural signal: [[Sensation]]
	4. Transmission of neural signal to the brain
	5. Cortical Processing: Perception
	6. Active feedback

| *Thresholds* | Amount of stimulation for a person to detect a stimulus <br> `Related Theories` [[Psychophysics]], [[Signal Detection Theory]] |
| Neuronal | [[Neuron]] <br> [[Neural Measurements]] |
| ==Cognitive== | [[Cognitive Perception]] |

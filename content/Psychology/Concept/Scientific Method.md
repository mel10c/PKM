Define [[Hypothesis]]  <br> 4. [[Test Hypothesis]] (Experiment/Observation)  <br> 5. [[Data\|Result]] Analysis  <br> 6. Draw conclusion (regarding evidence vs. hypothesis)

## Goals of Scientific Method

1.  [[Empiricism]]: knowledge is gained through observation (of mind)/**effects** of of the mind
    -   To be scientifically accepted the unobservable should do something **useful**
2.  *Determinism*: things have a cause
3.  *Testability*: can be tested
4.  *Parsimony*: simplest explanation is the best one

## Type of Research

| ==Purpose==:                                                                                 | ==Purpose==:                                                                                     |
| Expand knowledge of processes of business and management                                 | Improve understanding of particular business or management problem                           |
| Results in universal principles relating to the process and its relationship to outcomes | Results in solution to problem                                                               |

| Findings of significance and value to society in general                                 | Findings of practical relevance and value to manager(s) in organisation(s)                   |
| ==Context==:                                                                                 | ==Context==:                                                                                     |
| Undertaken by people based in universities                                               | Undertaken by people based in a variety of settings including organisations and universities |
| Choice of topic and objectives determined by the researcher                              | Objectives negotiated with originator                                                        |
| Flexible time scales                                                                     | Tight time scales                                                                            |

- *Pure research* is motivated primarily by the curiosity of the researcher—it is done solely for the purpose of acquiring knowledge
- *Applied research* is intended to bring about some direct benefit to humankind

# Thoughts

- Objective problem of the linear discovery cycle
	- ![[G. - Chapter 1#Objectivity of Science]]
	- [[Logic]]: Logical is the foundation of science, and science as "objective" is the foundational POV human has about the world
	- This might not be accurate, but is the best solution for human to understand the [[Nihilism|chaotic basis]] of the real world

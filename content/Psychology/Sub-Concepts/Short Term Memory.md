```ad-theorem
- <u>Code</u>: sensory input after [[Attention#Definitions|attention]]  process
- <u>Limiting factor</u>: $7 \pm 2$ audio memory, $4 \pm 1$ visual memory for 10-20s
- <u>Process</u>: maintenance by rehearsal (encode to LTM); unrehearsed gets lost
```

# Processes

- [[Working Memory]] is a cognitive tool in STM]
    - Alan Baddeley proposed that STM should be considered as working memory
- Without **rehearsal** the duration of STM is only a few seconds **(10-20s)**
    - *Rehearsal*: repeating info mentally to maintain attention
    - [[Attention]] determines duration
    - Rehearsal keeps information in STM and helps pass it on to long-term memory

# Capacity

- [[George Miller]] proposed the **“Magical Number $7 \pm 2$” chunks** is the capacity of STM "slot" ^584e59
    - Each slots holds a **meaningful** information
    - Chunk information in STM on the basis of information we already have in [[Long Term Memory]]
    - `Digit span`: the experimental measure of verbal short term and working memory 
- `Acoustically/verbally Experiment` ^a20e8b
    - <u>Method</u> & <u>Result</u>

    - *Phonological similarity effect*: Short-term memory span is smaller for rhyming lists (even though info presented visually) ^476ddc
    - *Word length effect*: longer the word, lower the digit span ^6b6dac
    - Verbal coding is default
- `Visual STM` ^cf0ecb
    - <u>Method</u>

    - <u>Result</u>
        1. Iconic memory has 9-12 items
        2. Attention focus on some (capacity about 4)
        3. Move to visual STM
        4. The number that people are able to hold in mind for 10-20s

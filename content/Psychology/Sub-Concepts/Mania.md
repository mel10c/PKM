##### Mania
> ------------------------------------------------------------
> A distinct period of **elevated**, expansive, or irritable mood that lasts at least **one week** and is accompanied by at least three associated symptoms.
>
> ------------------------------------------------------------

- <u>Surface symptoms</u>: increased **energy**, decreased need for **sleep**, racing **thoughts**, pressured **speech**, and problems with **attention and concentration**
- <u>Judgement impairment</u>: these individuals may go on **spending** sprees, engage in **substance abuse** or risky sexual behaviour, or may even become aggressive
- <u>Illusion</u>: feel that they are special in some way, or that they have been “chosen” to fulfill a special mission
- *Hypomanic* episodes may be experienced as a period of **successful high productivity**
    - A less severe form of **mania** that involves a similar number of symptoms, but those symptoms need to be present for only **four days**

### Diagnosis for Manic Episode

- (A). A distinct period of abnormally and persistently **elevated, expansive, or irritable mood** and abnormally and persistently increased **goal-directed activity** or energy, lasting at least <u>1 week and present most of the day</u>, nearly every day (or any duration if hospitalization is necessary).
- (B). During the period of mood disturbance and increased energy or activity, <u>three</u> (or more) of the following symptoms (four if the mood is only irritable) are present to a significant degree and represent a noticeable change from usual behavior:
    1. Inflated **self-esteem** or grandiosity.
    2. Decreased need for **sleep** (e.g., feels rested after only 3 hours of sleep).
    3. More talkative than usual or pressure to keep **talking**.
    4. Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are **racing**.
    5. **Distractibility** (i.e., attention too easily drawn to unimportant or irrelevant external stimuli), as reported or observed.
    6. Increase in **goal-directed activity** (either socially, at work or school, or sexually) or psychomotor agitation (i.e., purposeless non-goal-directed activity).
    7. Excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for **painful consequences** (e.g., engaging in unrestrained buying sprees, sexual indiscretions, or foolish business investments).
- (C). The mood disturbance is sufficiently severe to cause marked impairment in social or occupational functioning or to necessitate hospitalization to prevent harm to self or others, or there are psychotic features.
- (D). The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication, other treatment) or to another medical condition. Note: A full manic episode that emerges during antidepressant treatment (e.g., medication, electroconvulsive therapy) but persists at a fully syndromal level beyond the physiological effect of that treatment is sufficient evidence for a manic episode and, therefore, a bipolar I diagnosis.
- Note: Criteria A–D constitute a manic episode. At least one lifetime manic episode is required for the diagnosis of bipolar I disorder.

### Diagnosis for Hypomanic Episode

- (A). A distinct period of abnormally and persistently **elevated, expansive, or irritable mood** and abnormally and persistently **increased activity** or energy, lasting at least <u>4 consecutive days</u> and present most of the day, nearly every day.
- (B). During the period of mood disturbance and increased energy and activity, <u>three</u> (or more) of the following symptoms (four if the mood is only irritable) have persisted, represent a noticeable change from usual behavior, and have been present to a significant degree:
    1. Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity.
    2. Decreased need for sleep (e.g., feels rested after only 3 hours of sleep).
    3. More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking.
    4. Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing.
    5. Distractibility (i.e., attention too easily drawn to unimportant or irrelevant external stimuli), as reported or observed.
    6. Increase in goal-directed activity (either socially, at work or school, or sexually) or psychomotor agitation.
    7. Excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for painful consequences (e.g., engaging in unrestrained buying sprees, sexual indiscretions, or foolish business investments).
- (C). The episode is associated with an unequivocal change in functioning that is **uncharacteristic of the individual** when not symptomatic.
- (D). The disturbance in mood and the change in functioning are **observable** by others.
- (E). The episode is not severe enough to cause marked impairment in social or occupational functioning or to necessitate hospitalization. If there are psychotic features, the episode is, by definition, manic.
- (F). The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication, other treatment).
    - Note: A full hypomanie episode that emerges during antidepressant treatment (e.g., medication, electroconvulsive therapy) but persists at a fully syndromal level beyond the physiological effect of that treatment is sufficient evidence for a hypomanie episode diagnosis. However, caution is indicated so that one or two symptoms (particularly increased irritability, edginess, or agitation following antidepressant use) are not taken as sufficient for diagnosis of a hypomanie episode, nor necessarily indicative of a bipolar diathesis.
- Note: Criteria A-'F constitute a hypomanie episode. Hypomanie episodes are common in bipolar I disorder but are not required for the diagnosis of bipolar I disorder.

### Social Influence

- At first, the symptoms of may be experienced as **enjoyable**
    - Individuals may feel an abundance of **energy** and report that they are able to get a lot of things done
    - Their minds may seem clear and sharply **focused**, allowing them to solve difficult problems and make keen insights.
    - **Delay seeking treatment**, or **stop taking their medication**


## Etiology

- [[Neurotransmitters]] 
    - High [[Dopamine|DA]] level `->` hyperactivity and [[Psychotic Disorder|Psychosis]]
    - High [[Norepinephrine|NE]]level `->` euphoria and grandiosity
    - Low [[Serotonin|5-HT]] `->` disinhibition of related behaviours

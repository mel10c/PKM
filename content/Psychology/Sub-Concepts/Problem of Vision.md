## Problem of Accommodation

- *Accommodation*: process of changing the lens of the [[Eye]] to alter the refractive power
    - [[Light#^b4cb40|Refraction]] is necessary to focus light on to cornea

| <img src="https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/e6c9d24egy1h596t3otxvj20a80ngab1.jpg" width="150"> | *Emmetropia*: the normal condition with no refractive error  <br> *Myopia/近视*: light focused in front of retina, distances object not seem properly <br> *Hyperopia/远视*: light focused behind the retina, near object not seem properly |

## Other Problems

- *Cataracts/白内障*: loss of transparency in lens (solved with silicone implants)
- *Presbyopia/老花眼*: "old sight". Inability to accommodate nearby objects.

## Problem of Retina

- *Retinitis pigmentosa*: A family of hereditary diseases that involve the progressive death of [[Eye#^43bbc2|photoreceptors]] and degeneration of the pigment epithelium
- *Macular Degeneration*: Degeneration of the "macula": central vision, sharp details.
    - `Loss in central vision -> blindness`

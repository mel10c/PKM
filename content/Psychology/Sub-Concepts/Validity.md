> ------------------------------------------------------------
> Main extent to which a concept, conclusion or measurement is well-founded and likely corresponds accurately to the real world

> ------------------------------------------------------------

### Experimental 

- *Construct validity*: how well a conceptual variable is operationalized?
    - Subjective measurement
        - *Face validity*: means that the items on a test **resemble** the characteristics of the concept being measured
        - *Content validity*: 
    - Objective
        - *Criterion validity*: arises because some qualities are easier to **recognize** than to define completely (Correlational evidence; Known groups paradigm)
        - *Convergent validity* – strong correlation with measures of similar constructs
        - *Discriminant validity* – weak or no correlation with measures of dissimilar constructs
- *Statistical validity*: are the statistical conclusions precise, reasonable, replicable?
- *External validity*: does the study have generalizability
- *Internal validity*: is the causal relationship trustworthy?

### Diagnostic

- *Concurrent validity*: presence of non-symptom attributes
- *Predictive validity*: score on one assessment predict score on other assessments

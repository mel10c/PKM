- $r$: correlation ratio
- $r^2$: the percent of variance accounted for
- *Test-retest reliability*: the degree to which a test of a stable trait or characteristic generates the same results when it is given more than once to the same person
- *Inter-rater reliability*: the degree of agreement among independent observers who rate, code, or assess the same phenomenon ^430cfb
- *Internal consistency* : the degree of reliability within a test; one measure is split-half reliability, which compares responses on odd numbers to responses on even numbers

- *Alternate-form reliability* : two versions of the same test are designed and scores from each are correlated with one another
- *Coefficient alpha*: calculated by **averaging the intercorrelations** of all items within a test
    - Close to $1.00$ `->` higher correlation

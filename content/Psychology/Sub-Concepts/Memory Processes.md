## Encoding

> [Reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encoding_(memory))

- *Encoding* - initial storage into memory
- Strategies for encoding
    1. Relate/[[law of Association|Association]] to prior knowledge
    2. Understanding of the concept (depth of processing)

## Consolidation

> [Reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_consolidation#Systems_consolidation)

- *Storage/consolidation* - maintaining the stored memory
- *Consolidation period*: [[Semantic Memory]] and [[Episodic Memory]] appear to be subject to a time window called the consolidation period during which they are **vulnerable and easily lost**. Each time a memory is accessed, it may become vulnerable again and need to be reconsolidated.
- ==Two Processes==  of consolidation ^c45b78
    1. *Synaptic consolidation*: correspond to late-phase [[Long-term potentiation]] occurs on a small scale in the **synaptic connections** and neural circuits within the first few hours after learning
    2. *Systems consolidation*: occurring on a much larger scale in the brain; rendering [[Long Term Memory#Declarative Memory|hippocampus-dependent]] memories independent of the [[hippocampus]] over a period of weeks to years
- Reconsolidation
    - [[Electroconvulsive therapy|ECT]]  disrupts recently-acquired memories

#### Standard Consolidation Theory

-   During learning, the MTL **relays information to the cortex**
-   Over time, the cortex gets the message and the memories become independent of the MTL

#### Multiple Memory Trace Theory

-   The MTL helps **organize** together the distributed **semantic facts into specific episodic memories**
-   True episodic memories are never fully independent of the MTL

## Retrieval

> [Reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recall_(memory))

- *Retrieval* - re-activating the memory for further processing
- Related strategies
    - *Encoding specificity effect*: retrieval is likely to be more successful if encoding and retrieval **conditions match**
    - *Transfer-appropriate processing (TAP)*: that memory retrieval will be best if **processing is similar** at encoding and testing
    - More cues `->` better recall
    - **Struggling** to retrieve material (such as during a test) often promotes longer-lasting memories than simply studying the material again.

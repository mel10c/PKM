```

- *Working Memory*: workspace for the mind; it collects sensory input, activates relevant LTMs, and transforms information to suit current needs
- Difference between STM and WM ^b4212a
	- [[Short Term Memory|STM]]: **passive storage** (visuo-spatial storage) + (phonological loop [verbal])
	- WM: **active processing** (initiating retrieval, planning, integrating info)

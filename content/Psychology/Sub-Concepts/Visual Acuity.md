## Light adaptation

1. [[Eye#^418086|Pupils]] regulates the amount of light entering the eye
2. [[Eye#^43bbc2|Photopigment]] regeneration limits amount of captured light
3. [[Eye#^43bbc2|Photoreceptors]] different sensitivity to light
4. [[Eye#^7863a9|Ganglion cells]] ignore variation in overall light level via centresurround contrasts

## Visual Acuity

- *Acuity*: The smallest spatial detail that can be resolved
- Measurements
    - <u>Herman Snellen</u> invented method for visual acuity (measures distance), famous $E$ chart
    - $$ \frac{\text{distance at which patient can just identify the letters}}{\text{distance at which a person with "normal" vision can just identify the letters}} $$
- ==Contrast Sensitivity Function==
    - <img src="https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/e6c9d24egy1h5aq39aveej20q60k60u1.jpg" width="300">
    - Peaks 2-4 cycles/degree for *photopic* (daylight) vision, reduced for *mesopic* (twilight) and *scotopic* (nighttime) vision
    - *Spatial Frequency*: The number of cycles of a grating per unit of visual angle (usually specified in degrees)
        - [[Eye#^7863a9|Ganglion cells]] respond differently to gratings of different spatial frequencies
    - *Contrast*: The difference in illumination between a figure and its background.
        - *Contrast Threshold*: minimum contrast

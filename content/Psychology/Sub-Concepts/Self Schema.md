# Self Schema

- Self knowledge is stored in memory in [[Cognitive Model|Cognitive structure]] called the self schema
- Storehouse of [[Social Self#Self Knowledge|self knowledge]]
- Development and organization of a maladaptive self-schema occurs during early **childhood**
	- Does not become active until it is triggered by negative life events
- Different types of beliefs are considered to be related to different kinds of abnormal behaviourâ€”what Beck referred to as *content-specificity*

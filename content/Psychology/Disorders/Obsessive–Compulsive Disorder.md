##### Obsessive–Compulsive Disorder
> ------------------------------------------------------------
> An individual has *intrusive thoughts* and/or feels the need to perform certain routines repeatedly to the extent where it induces distress or impairs general function
>
> ------------------------------------------------------------

## Symptoms

- *Obsessions*: thoughts, images, or **urges** that are persistent, unwanted and markedly **distressing**
- *Compulsions*: **repetitive behaviours** (e.g., checking) or mental acts (e.g., counting) that a person performs to **reduce anxiety**/distress or to prevent a feared outcome
- *Neutralizations*: brief behavioural or mental acts that individuals employ in response to an intrusion, to prevent or **“undo” the feared situations** that appear in their intrusive thought

## Diagnosis

- (A) Presence of **obsessions, compulsions**, or both:
    - Obsessions are defined by (1) and (2):
        1. **Recurrent and persistent thoughts**, urges, or images that are experienced, at some time during the disturbance, as intrusive and unwanted, and that in most individuals cause marked anxiety or distress.
        2. The individual attempts to **ignore or suppress such thoughts**, urges, or images, or to neutralize them with some other thought or action (i.e., by performing a compulsion).
    - Compulsions are defined by (1) and (2):
        1. **Repetitive** behaviors (e.g., hand washing, ordering, checking) or mental acts (e.g., praying, counting, repeating words silently) that the individual feels driven to perform in response to an obsession or according to rules that must be applied rigidly.
        2. The behaviors or mental acts are aimed at **preventing or reducing anxiety** or distress, or preventing some dreaded event or situation; however, these behaviors or mental acts are not connected in a realistic way with what they are designed to neutralize or prevent, or are clearly excessive. Note: Young children may not be able to articulate the aims of these behaviors or mental acts.
- (B) The obsessions or compulsions are time-consuming (e.g., take more than 1 hour per day) or cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
- (C) The obsessive-compulsive symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition.
- (D) The disturbance is not better explained by the symptoms of another mental disorder (e.g., excessive worries, as in generalized anxiety disorder; preoccupation with appearance, as in body dysmorphic disorder; difficulty discarding or parting with possessions, as in hoarding disorder; hair pulling, as in trichotillomania [hair-pulling disorder]; skin picking, as in excoriation [skin-picking] disorder; stereotypies, as in stereotypic movement disorder; ritualized eating behavior, as in eating disorders; preoccupation with substances or gambling, as in substance-related and addictive disorders; preoccupation with having an illness, as in illness anxiety disorder; sexual urges or fantasies, as in paraphilic disorders; impulses, as in disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorders; guilty ruminations, as in major depressive disorder; thought insertion or delusional preoccupations, as in schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders; or repetitive patterns of behavior, as in autism spectrum disorder).

- *Specify IF*:
    - With good or fair insiglit: The individual recognizes that obsessive-compulsive disorder beliefs are definitely or probably not true or that they may or may not be true.
    - With poor insight: The individual thinks obsessive-compulsive disorder beliefs are probably true.
    - With absent insight/deiusionai beiiefs: The individual is completely convinced that obsessive-compulsive disorder beliefs are true.
- *Specify IF*:
    - Tic-reiated: The individual has a current or past history of a tic disorder.

## Etiology

- Drug-induced OCD
- Genetics
- Brain structure and functioning
    - [[Basal Ganglia]] hyperactivity + [[Frontal Lobe]]
    - SSRIs - [[Serotonin]] neurotransmission
- Autoimmune
- Environment
    - [[Cognitive Model]]
        - Obsessions are caused by the person’s reaction to their own intrusive thoughts
        - Catastrophic **misinterpretations** of these thoughts
        - Unhelpful efforts to control the intrusions (ex. thought suppression)

## Prognosis

## Treatment

- Exposure with ritual prevention + [[Cognitive Behavioural Therapy|CBT]]

## Prevention

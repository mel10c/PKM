##### Autism spectrum disorder
> ------------------------------------------------------------
> A range of [[Neurodevelopmental Disorders]] characterized by difficulties in social interactions and communication, repetitive behaviors, intense interests, and unusual responses to sensory stimuli

## Symptom

1.  Deficits in social-emotional reciprocity
2.  Deficits in nonverbal communicative behaviors
3.  Deficits in developing, maintaining and understanding relationship

## Diagnostic

- (A) **Communication** Impairment (due to social interpretation impairment)
    1. Deficits in social-emotional reciprocity
        - Use protoimperative gestures rather than protodeclarative gestures: inconsistent use of early preverbal communication
        - *Protoimperative*: point to desirable object
        - *Protodeclarative*: eye-contact and joined [[Attention]]
    1. Deficits in nonverbal communicative behaviors
        - Gap in the verbal vs. non-verbal skills
    2. Deficits in developing, maintaining and understanding relationship
        - <u> Social</u>: More sensitive to environment; thus tend to isolate themselves to avoid overwhelming
        - <u>Neurology</u> [[Stress]] can contribute, but the root cause is social interaction comprehension
- (B) Restricted respective patterns of behavior, interest ,or activities (>2)
    1. Stereotyped or respective motor movements, use of objects, or speech
    2. Insistence on sameness
    3. Highly restricted, fixated interest that abnormal in intensity or focus
    4. Hyper-or hyperactivity to sensory input or unusual interest in sensory aspects of environment
- (C) Must be present in early developmental period (can be masked away)
- (D) Significant impairments in functioning
- (E) These disturbances are **not better explained** by intellectual disability or global developmental delay.

### Severity

| Severity Level                               | Social Communication                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Restricted Interests & Repetitive Behaviors                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Level 3 - Requiring very substantial support | Severe deficits in verbal and nonverbal social communication skills cause severe impairments in functioning; very limited initiation of social interactions and minimal response to social overtures from others.                                                                                          | Preoccupations, fixated rituals and/or repetitive behaviors markedly interfere with the functioning in all spheres. Marked distress when rituals or routines are interrupted; very difficult to redirect from fixated interest or returns to it quickly.                                                                                       |
| Level 2 - Requiring substantial support      | Marked deficits in verbal and nonverbal social communication skills; social impairments apparent even with supports in place; limited initiation of social interactions and reduced or abnormal response to social overtures from others.                                                                  | Rituals and repetitive behaviors and/or preoccupations or fixated interests appear frequently enough to be obvious to the casual observer and interfere with the functioning in a variety of contexts. Distress or frustration is apparent when rituals and repetitive behaviors are interrupted; difficult to redirect from fixated interest. |
| Level 1 - Requiring support                  | Without supports in place, deficits in social communication cause noticeable impairments. Has difficulty initiating social interactions and demonstrates clear examples of atypical or unsuccessful responses to social overtures of others. May appear to have decreased interest in social interactions. | Rituals and repetitive behaviors cause significant interference with functioning in one or more contexts. Resists attempts by others to interrupt rituals or repetitive behavior or to be redirected from fixated interest.                                                                                                                    |

## Etiology

- Genetics
    - [[Fragile X syndrome]] co-occur in $2-3\%$
- [[Prenatal Environment]]
    - Experience more health problems during pregnancy, at birth, or immediately following birth
    - Prenatal complications: parental age

## Prognosis

## Treatment

## Prevention

## Society

- Higher diagnosis in boys ($4X$) higher in boys
    - Girls' threshold for genetic mutation is harder
    - Girls with autism will have a greater functionality than boys
    - The mutations manifest differently in girls
    - Girls show less repetitive behaviour

## Etiology

- The mood disorders are highly **heritable**
    - A genetic **vulnerability** likely needs to be expressed as a vulnerable personality or cognitive trait and **triggered by stress** in the environment
- Psychological and environmental factors
    - [[Psychoanalysis|Psychodynamic]]'s interpretation
        - [[Relationships]] between parents and children are important in shaping a child’s [[temperament]]
        - 2 personality patterns that they theorize provide a risk for depression: *dependency* and *self-criticism*
    - [[Cognitive Model#^243f3c|Cognitive Model]]
    - Maladaptive interpersonal interpretation
        - *Negative feedback seeking*: seek out criticism and other negative interpersonal feedback that is consistent with their [[Self Schema]]
        - *Excessive reassurance seeking*: repeatedly seek assurance about one’s worth and lovability from others,
        - ==Stress generation hypothesis==: depressed individuals contribute to the occurrence of these events due to their maladaptive interpersonal behaviours
    - Stress Factors
        - Negative `->` increased depression potential
        - Rewarding `->` increased manic potential
    - Childhood stress: Child abuse `->` $5 \times$ to develop depression
        - [[Cognitive Model]]: maltreatment is internalized by the child in the form of **negative cognitive schemas**
        - Child abuse `<->` with the death of cells in the [[hippocampus]] and [[Amygdala]]
        - Child abuse `<->` dysregulation of [[HPA axis]]

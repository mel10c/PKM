- *Somatic delusions*: involve beliefs related to the patient’s **body**. 
    - Ex. Patients who were convinced that their inner organs had been turned to dust
- *Religious delusion*: often involves the belief that biblical or other religious passages or stories **offer the way to destroy or to save the world**
- *Delusions of grandeur*:  may entail a belief in divine or **special powers** that can change the course of history OR communication channel to God.

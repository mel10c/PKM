### Prevalence

## Diagnosis

- (A) A pervasive pattern of social and interpersonal deficits marked by acute discomfort with, and reduced capacity for, close relationships as well as by cognitive or perceptual distortions and eccentricities of behavior, beginning by early adulthood and present in a variety of contexts, as indicated by <u>five (or more)</u> of the following:
    1. Ideas of **reference** (excluding delusions of reference).
    2. Odd beliefs or **magical thinking** that influences behavior and is inconsistent with subcultural norms (e.g., superstitiousness, belief in clairvoyance, telepathy, or “sixth sense”: in children and adolescents, bizarre fantasies or preoccupations).
    3. Unusual **perceptual experiences**, including bodily illusions.
    4. **Odd** thinking and speech (e.g., vague, circumstantial, metaphorical, overelaborate, or stereotyped).
    5. **Suspiciousness** or paranoid ideation. 
    6. Inappropriate or **constricted** affect.
    7. Behavior or appearance that is **odd**, eccentric, or peculiar.
    8. **Lack of close friends** or confidants other than first-degree relatives.
    9. Excessive **social anxiety** that does not diminish with familiarity and tends to be associated with paranoid fears rather than negative judgments about self
- (B) Does not occur exclusively during the course of schizophrenia, a bipolar disorder or depressive disorder with psychotic features, another psychotic disorder, or autism spectrum disorder.
- Note: If criteria are met prior to the onset of schizophrenia, add “premorbid,” e.g., “schizotypal personality disorder (premorbid).”

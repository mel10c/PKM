## Diagnosis

- Stress Factors
    - $75\%$ of patient have suffered $>1$ severe loss event in the $3-6$ months prior to onset of their depression

### DSM Diagnostic Criteria

- (A). <u>Five</u> (or more) of the following symptoms have been present during the same 2-week period and represent a change from previous functioning: at least one of the symptoms is either (1) depressed mood or (2) loss of interest or pleasure. Note: Do not include symptoms that are clearly attributable to another medical condition.
    1. ★ **Depressed mood most of the day**, nearly every day, as indicated by either subjective report (e.g., feels sad, empty, hopeless) or observation made by others (e.g., appears tearful). (Note: In children and adolescents, can be irritable mood.)
    2. ★ Markedly **diminished interest** or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities most of the day, nearly every day (as indicated by either subjective account or observation).
    3. Significant **weight loss** when not dieting or **weight gain** (e.g., a change of more than 5% of body weight in a month), or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every day. (Note: In children, consider failure to make expected weight gain.)
    4. **Insomnia** or **hypersomnia** nearly every day.
    5. Psychomotor **agitation or retardation** nearly every day (observable by others, not merely subjective feelings of restlessness or being slowed down).
    6. **Fatigue** or loss of energy nearly every day.
    7. Feelings of **worthlessness** or excessive or inappropriate guilt (which may be delusional) nearly every day (not merely self-reproach or guilt about being sick).
    8. Diminished ability to think or **concentrate**, or indecisiveness, nearly every day (either by subjective account or as observed by others).
    9. **Recurrent thoughts of death** (not just fear of dying), recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide.
- (B). The symptoms cause clinically significant **distress** or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
- (C). The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or to another medical condition.
- Note: Criteria `A-C` represent a major depressive episode.
- Note: Responses to a significant loss (e.g., bereavement, financial ruin, losses from a natural disaster, a serious medical illness or disability) may include the feelings of intense sadness, rumination about the loss, insomnia, poor appetite, and weight loss noted in Criterion A, which may resemble a depressive episode. Although such symptoms may be understandable or considered appropriate to the loss, the presence of a major depressive episode in addition to the normal response to a significant loss should also be carefully considered. This decision inevitably requires the exercise of clinical judgment based on the individual’s history and the cultural norms for the expression of distress in the context of loss.^
- (D). The occurrence of the major depressive episode is not better explained by schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder, or other specified and unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders.
- (E). There has never been a manic episode or a hypomanie episode.
    - Note: This exclusion does not apply if all of the manic-like or hypomanic-like episodes are substance-induced or are attributable to the physiological effects of another medical condition.

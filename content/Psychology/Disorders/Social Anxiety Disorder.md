> ------------------------------------------------------------
> sentiments of [[Fear]] and [[Anxiety]] in social situations, causing considerable **distress** and impaired ability to function in at least some aspects of daily life
>
> ------------------------------------------------------------

## Symptoms

- Interpersonal disorder
- Intensely afraid of social or performance situations
- Fear of showing signs of anxiety or worry that they will behave in a socially inept manner
- Onset: late childhood, adolescence
- High comorbidity (ex. depression, substance use)
-   Individuals with social anxiety are generally well aware of the fact that their fears are excessive and unreasonable.

## Diagnosis

- (A) Marked **fear or anxiety about one or more social situations** in which the individual is exposed to possible scrutiny by others. 
    - Examples include social interactions (e.g., having a conversation, meeting unfamiliar people), being observed (e.g., eating or drinking), and performing in front of others (e.g., giving a speech).
    - Note: In children, the anxiety must occur in peer settings and not just during interactions with adults.
- (B) The individual fears that he or she will act in a way or show anxiety symptoms that will be **negatively evaluated** (i.e., will be humiliating or embarrassing: will lead to rejection or offend others).
- (C). The social situations almost always **provoke fear or anxiety**.
    - Note: In children, the fear or anxiety may be expressed by crying, tantrums, freezing, clinging, shrinking, or failing to speak in social situations.
- (D). The social situations are **avoided** or endured with intense fear or anxiety.
- (E). The fear or anxiety is **out of proportion** to the actual threat posed by the social situation and to the sociocultural context.
- (F). The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is **persistent**, typically lasting for 6 months or more.
- (G). The fear, anxiety, or avoidance causes clinically significant **distress** or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
- (H) The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition.
- (I). The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is not better explained by the symptoms of another mental disorder, such as panic disorder, body dysmoφhic disorder, or autism spectrum disorder.
- (J). If another medical condition (e.g., Parkinson’s disease, obesity, disfigurement from bums or injury) is present, the fear, anxiety, or avoidance is clearly unrelated or is excessive
- *Specific IF*: Performance only: If the fear is restricted to speaking or performing in public

- Structured or semi-structured interview combined with completion of various self-report measures.

## Etiology

- Genetic 
    - $50\%$
    - [[Temperament]]: Behavioural inhibition
    - Brain structures involved
        - Fear recognition and conditioning (e.g. [[Amygdala]])
        - Anxious arousal and stress (e.g. [[HPA axis]])
        - Monitoring of negative affect (e.g. [[Prefrontal Cortex]] and orbitofrontal cortex)
    - [[Neurotransmitters]]
        - Dysregulation of [[Serotonin]], [[Norepinephrine]], and other neurotransmission systems during stress responses are likely associated with socially anxious behaviour
- Environmental Influence
    - Being victimized (bullying, teasing) during childhood
- Cultural 
- Substance
- Psychological Factors
    - Self-focused attention – highly self-critical
    - Public self-consciousness
    - Dishonest self-disclosure - Less authentic manner in interactions with others

## Prognosis

## Treatment

- CBGT + cognitive restructuring and exposure

    3. **Identity disturbance**: markedly and persistently unstable self-image or sense of self.
    4. **Impulsivity** in at least two areas that are potentially self-damaging (e.g., spending, sex, substance abuse, reckless driving, binge eating). (Note: Do not include suicidal or self mutilating behavior covered in Criterion 5.)
    5. Recurrent **suicidal** behavior, gestures, or threats, or self-mutilating behavior.

    7. Chronic feelings of **emptiness**.
    8. Inappropriate, intense anger or difficulty **controlling anger** (e.g., frequent displays of temper, constant anger, recurrent physical fights).

##### Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder
> ------------------------------------------------------------
> Non-recovery in response to an event that threatened one’s life or bodily integrity.
>
> ------------------------------------------------------------


## Symptoms

- Recurrent **re-experiencing** of the traumatic event (e.g., nightmares)
- **Persistent** emotional or physiological **arousal** in response to reminders of the trauma
- Maladaptive **changes in thinking patterns** (now seeing the world as a dangerous place) and in mood (emotional numbing)
- **Hyperarousal** and hyperreactivity (e.g., chronic startle, quick to anger)

### Prevalence

- `Women > Man`
    - Women: $20\%$; Men: $8\%$

## Diagnosis

- Note: The following criteria apply to adults, adolescents, and children older than 6 years. For children 6 years and younger, see corresponding criteria below.
- (A). **Exposure** to actual or threatened **death**, serious **injury**, or **sexual violence** in one (or more) of the following ways:
    1. Directly experiencing the traumatic event(s).
    2. Witnessing, in person, the event(s) as it occurred to others.
    3. Learning that the traumatic event(s) occurred to a close family member or close friend. In cases of actual or threatened death of a family member or friend, the event(s) must have been violent or accidental.
    4. Experiencing repeated or extreme exposure to aversive details of the traumatic event(s) (e.g., first responders collecting human remains; police officers repeatedly exposed to details of child abuse).
        - Note: Criterion A4 does not apply to exposure through electronic media, television, movies, or pictures, unless this exposure is work related.
- (B). Presence of one (or more) of the following **intrusion symptoms** associated with the traumatic events(s), beginning after the traumatic event(s) occurred.
    1. Recurrent, involuntary, and intrusive distressing memories of the traumatic event(s).
        - Note: In children older than 6 years, repetitive play may occur in which themes or aspects of the traumatic event(s) are expressed.
    2. Recurrent distressing dreams in which the content and/or affect of the dream are related to the traumatic event(s)
        - Note: In children, there may be frightening dreams without recognizable content.
    3. Dissociative reactions (e.g., flashbacks) in which the individual feels or acts as if the traumatic event(s) were recurring. (Such reactions may occur on the continuum, with the most extreme expression being a complete loss of awareness of present surroundings.)
        - Note: In children, trauma-specific reenactment may occur in play.
    4. Intense or prolonged psychological distress at exposure to internal or external cues that symbolize or resemble an aspect of the traumatic event(s).
    5. Marked physiological reactions to internal or external cues that symbolize or resemble an aspect of the traumatic event(s).
- (C). Persistent **avoidance of stimuli** associated with the traumatic event(s), beginning after the traumatic event(s) occurred, as evidenced by one or both of the following:
    1. Avoidance of or efforts to avoid distressing memories, thoughts, or feelings about or closely associated with the traumatic events(s).
    2. Avoidance of or efforts to avoid external reminders (people, places, conversations, activities, objects, situations) that arouse distressing memories, thoughts, or feelings about or closely associated with the traumatic event(s).
- (D). **Negative alternations** in cognitions and mood associated with the traumatic event(s) (typically due to dissociative amnesia and not to other factors such as head injury, alcohol, or drugs).
    1. Inability to remember an important aspect of the traumatic event(s) (typically due to dissociative amnesia and not to other factors such as head injury, alcohol, or drugs).
    2. Persistent and exaggerated negative beliefs or expectations about oneself, others, or the world (e.g., “I am bad,” “No one can be trusted,” “The world is completely dangerous,” “My whole nervous system is permanently ruined”).
    3. Persistent, distorted cognitions about the cause or consequences of the traumatic event(s) that lead the individual to blame himself/herself or others.
    4. Persistent negative emotional state (e.g., fear, horror, anger, guilt, or shame).
    5. Markedly diminished interest or participation in significant activities.
    6. Feelings of detachment or estrangement from others.
    7. Persistent inability to experience positive emotions (e.g., inability to experience happiness, satisfaction, or loving feelings).
- (E). Marked **alterations in arousal** and reactivity associated with the traumatic event(s), beginning or worsening after the traumatic event(s) occurred, as evidenced by two (or more) of the following:
    1. Irritable behavior and angry outbursts (with little or no provocation) typically expressed as verbal or physical aggression toward people or objects.
    2. Reckless or self-destructive behavior.
    3. Hypervigilance.
    4. Exaggerated startle response.
    5. Problems with concentration.
    6. Sleep disturbance (e.g., difficulty falling or staying asleep or restless sleep).
- (F). Duration of the disturbance (Criteria B, C, D, and E) is more than 1 month.
- (G). The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
- (H). The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., medication, alcohol) or another medical condition.

## Etiology

- *Pre-event* risk factors:
    - Low socio-economic status, lower education and lower tested intelligence, and a childhood history of abuse.
- *Post-event* risk factors:
    - Severity of triggering event
    - Lack of social support
    - Presence of stressful experiences after the traumatic event
- Physiological
    - Dysfunctional neurocircuitry in areas of the brain implicated in **processing and responding quickly to threat**
    - *Innate Alarm System*: [[Brain#Hindbrain/Brainstem|brainstem]], [[Amygdala]], and [[Brain#Telencephalon|frontotemporal]] cortex
        - **Greater** activity and connectivity between IAS brain regions
    - [[HPA axis]]
        - **Decreased** [[cortisol]] and/or enhanced negative feedback of adrenal function
    - [[Hippocampus]]
        - Volume of the hippocampus is less in individuals with PTSD
- Cognitive
    - ==Dual Representation Theory==: differences in the way that traumatic memories and non-traumatic memories may be stored and retrieved
        - Traumatic memories may be initially stored and retrieved in a **nonverbal sensory-based form**
        - Non-traumatic memories are typically encoded and retrieved in a **verbal form**

## Prognosis

## Treatment

- [[Cognitive Behavioural Therapy|CBT]]
- Pharmacotherapy
    - Benzodiazepines act on the neurotransmitter [[GABA]]
    - Tricyclic antidepressants (blocking the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin)
    - Venlafaxine hydrochloride
    - SSRIs

##### Schizophrenia
> ------------------------------------------------------------
> Continuous or relapsing episodes of **psychosis** ([[Psychotic Disorder#Hallucinations|Hallucinations]], [[Psychotic Disorder#Delusions|delusions]], and disorganized thinking)
> 
> Both egosyntonic and egodystonic
>
> ------------------------------------------------------------

## Symptoms

### Positive Symptoms

> [[Psychotic Disorder#^b9a47c|Positive Symptoms]] in Psychosis

- *Auditory [[Psychotic Disorder#Hallucinations|hallucinations]]*: (hearing voices) and other sounds occur in up to $70\%$ patients
    - Perceived as distinct from the **patient’s own thoughts** and may include instructions to perform actions that involve self-harm or danger
    - May be insulting at one point and complimentary at another
- [[Psychotic Disorder#Delusions|Delusions]]
- *Loosening of associations*:  and logical connections between ideas occurs and the thought disordered patient **shifts quickly from one topic to another** ^7a9a5a
- Moderately associated with impairment on objective tests of cognitive abilities, including [[Attention]], [[learning]] and [[memory]], and mental efficiency, and also relate to everyday functioning and community adjustment

### Negative Symptoms

> [[Psychotic Disorder#^37aa8b|Negative Symptoms]] in Psychosis

- *Diminished emotional expression*: failing to convey any feeling in their face, tone of voice, or body language
- Anhedonia is consistent with the patient’s apathy and denotes a **lack of pleasure or reward experiences**
- *Grossly disorganized behaviour*:  reflects difficulty with goal-directed behaviour
    - Unpredictable movements; problems performing everyday activities, such as dressing or preserving personal hygiene and inappropriate sexual behaviour
- *Catatonic behaviour*: in contrast, refers to the other end of the motor spectrum
    - Significant reduction in responsiveness to the environment wherein patients assume unusual and rigid postures and resist efforts by others to change their position
    - *Waxy flexibility*: allowing others to move their body and limbs and then maintaining the new position

### Prevalence

- Tend to manifest between late **adolescence and early adulthood** (typically between 15 and 45 years of age)
    - Rarely occurs before adolescence or after 45 years of age
- $>1\%$ in North America
- `Female = Male`

## Diagnosis

- (A). `>2` of the following, each **present** for a significant portion of time during a **1-month period** (or less if successfully treated). At least one of these must be (1 ), (2), or (3): ^3e5130
    1. ★Delusions.
    2. ★Hallucinations.
    3. ★Disorganized speech (e.g., frequent derailment or incoherence).
    4. Grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior.
    5. Negative symptoms (i.e., diminished emotional expression or avolition).
- (B). For a significant portion of the time since the onset of the disturbance, level of functioning in one or more major areas, such as work, interpersonal relations, or self-care, is markedly below the level achieved prior to the onset (or when the onset is in childhood or adolescence, there is failure to achieve expected level of interpersonal, academic, or occupational functioning).
- (C). Continuous signs of the **disturbance persist for at least 6 months**. This 6-month period must include at least 1 month of symptoms (or less if successfully treated) that meet Criterion A (i.e., active-phase symptoms) and may include periods of prodromal or residual symptoms. During these prodromal or residual periods, the signs of the disturbance may be manifested by only negative symptoms or by two or more symptoms listed in Criterion A present in an attenuated form (e.g., odd beliefs, unusual perceptual experiences).
- (D). Schizoaffective disorder and depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features have been ruled out because either 1) no major depressive or manic episodes have occurred concurrently with the active-phase symptoms, or 2) if mood episodes have occurred during active-phase symptoms, they have been present for a minority of the total duration of the active and residual periods of the illness.
- (E). The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition.
- (F). If there is a history of autism spectrum disorder or a communication disorder of childhood onset, the additional diagnosis of schizophrenia is made only if prominent delusions or hallucinations, in addition to the other required symptoms of schizophrenia, are also present for at least 1 month (or less if successfully treated).

- *Specify IF*: The following course specifiers are only to be used after a 1-year duration of the disorder and if they are not in contradiction to the diagnostic course criteria
    - First episode, currently in partial remission: Partial remission is a period of time during which an improvement after a previous episode is maintained and in which the defining criteria of the disorder are only partially fulfilled.
    - First episode, currently in full remission: Full remission is a period of time after a previous episode during which no disorder-specific symptoms are present.
    - Multiple episodes, currently in acute episode: Multiple episodes may be determined after a minimum of two episodes (i.e., after a first episode, a remission and a minimum of one relapse).
    - Multiple episodes, currently in partial remission
    - Multiple episodes, currently in full remission
    - Continuous: Symptoms fulfilling the diagnostic symptom criteria of the disorder are remaining for the majority of the illness course, with subthreshold symptom periods being very brief relative to the overall course.
    - Unspecified
- *Specify IF*
    - With catatonia (refer to the criteria for catatonia associated with another mental disorder, pp. 119-120, for definition).
    - Coding note: Use additional code 293.89 (F06.1) catatonia associated with schizophrenia to indicate the presence of the comorbid catatonia.
- *Specify* current severity:
    - Severity is rated by a quantitative assessment of the primary symptoms of psychosis, including delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, abnormal psychomotor behavior, and negative symptoms. Each of these symptoms may be rated for its current severity (most severe in the last 7 days) on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (not present) to 4 (present and severe). (See Clinician-Rated Dimensions of Psychosis Symptom Severity in the chapter “Assessment Measures.”)
    - Note: Diagnosis of schizophrenia can be made without using this severity specifier


## Etiology

- Recent studies support the idea that low socioeconomic status at birth makes development of a psychotic disorder more likely
- *Social drift* explanations held that people with schizophrenia experienced reduced social mobility due to symptoms
- The assumption is that vulnerability, or diathesis, and disorder-promoting events, or stress, are both required
- MEEHL’S THEORY

## Prevalence

- $1\%$ of general population
- Typical onset is 15-45
- `Female = Male`

## Prognosis

- Difficult and in need of further investigation
    - Poor outcome is more likely among males
- Tends to be a chronic and relapsing disorder
    - $1/7$ patients experiencing both remission (reduction) of symptoms and improved daily life functioning

### Comorbidity

- More likely to develop additional psychiatric problems, including [[Major Depressive Disorder|Depression]] and suicidal behaviour as well as [[Substance Use Disorder]]

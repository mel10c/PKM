## Diagnosis

- (A) A **pervasive distrust and suspiciousness of others** such that their motives are interpreted as malevolent, beginning by early adulthood and present in a variety of contexts, as indicated by <u>four (or more)</u> of the following:
    1. **Suspects**, without sufficient basis, that others are exploiting, harming, or deceiving him or her.
    2. Is **preoccupied with unjustified doubts** about the loyalty or trustworthiness of friends or associates.
    3. Is **reluctant to confide** in others because of unwarranted fear that the information will be used maliciously against him or her.
    4. Reads **hidden demeaning** or threatening meanings into benign remarks or events.
    5. Persistently **bears grudges** (i.e., is unforgiving of insults, injuries, or slights).
    6. **Perceives attacks** on his or her character or reputation that are not apparent to others and is quick to react angrily or to counterattack.
    7. Has recurrent suspicions, **without justification**, regarding fidelity of spouse or sexual partner
- (B) Does not occur exclusively during the course of schizophrenia, a bipolar disorder or depressive disorder with psychotic features, or another psychotic disorder and is not attributable to the physiological effects of another medical condition
- Note: If criteria are met prior to the onset of schizophrenia, add “premorbid,” i.e., “paranoid personality disorder (premorbid).”

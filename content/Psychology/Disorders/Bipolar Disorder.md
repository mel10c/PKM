- Connection with [[Schizophrenia]] and [[Major Depressive Disorder]]
    - `DSM-5` placed bipolar between schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders and depressive disorders in recognition of their place as a bridge between the two diagnostic classes in terms of **symptomatology**, **family history**, and **genetics**

### Prevalence

- `Suicidal Rate`: $10-15\%$
- `Female = Male`
- Age onset is 20 years old

## Diagnosis

- *SPECIFIER*
    - Rapid cycling bipolar disorder as the presence of <u>four or more</u> manic and/or major depressive episodes in a 12-month period
    - Patient have a higher rates of disability and lower rates of response to treatment

## Etiology

- Stress Factors
    - **Negative** loss events preferentially predict increases in **depressive** symptoms
    - Life events related to **reward** and goal attainment preferentially predict increases in **manic** symptoms
- Genetic
    - First degree family relative: $7-15 \times$ more likely to develop mood disorders
- [[Neurotransmitters]]
    - Mania: 

## Prognosis

- Children with bipolar disorder often **do not meet the strict DSM-5** definition, and tend to have a rapidcycling or mixed-cycling pattern

### Comorbidity

## Treatment

- Rapid cycling can be induced, or made worse, by antidepressant medications
- Important for patients who are receiving antidepressant treatment to also receive a mood stabilizer

##### Separation Anxiety Disorder
> ------------------------------------------------------------
> **Distress when separated** from the attachment figure
>
> ------------------------------------------------------------

## Symptoms

## Diagnosis

- (A) Developmentally inappropriate and **excessive fear or anxiety** concerning separation from those to whom the individual is attached, as evidenced by <u>at least three</u> of the following:
    1. ★ Recurrent excessive distress when **anticipating or experiencing separation** from home or from major attachment figures (typical in specific age)
    2. ★ Persistent and excessive worry about **losing major attachment figures** or about possible harm to them, such as illness, injury, disasters, or death
    3. Persistent and excessive worry about experiencing an **untoward event** (e.g., getting lost, being kidnapped, having an accident, becoming ill) that causes separation from a major attachment figure.
    4. Persistent reluctance or **refusal to go out**, away from home, to school, to work, or elsewhere because of fear of separation.
    5. Persistent and excessive fear of or reluctance about **being alone** or without major attachment figures at home or in other settings.
    6. Persistent reluctance or refusal to **sleep away from home** or to go to sleep without being near a major attachment figure.
    7. Repeated **nightmares** involving the theme of separation.
    8. ★ Repeated complaints of **physical symptoms** (e.g., headaches, stomachaches, nausea, vomiting) when separation from major attachment figures occurs or is anticipated
- (B). The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is persistent, lasting at least **4 weeks in children** and adolescents and typically **6 months or more in adults**.
- (C). The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, academic, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
- (D). The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder, such as refusing to leave home because of excessive resistance to change in autism spectrum disorder; delusions or hallucinations concerning separation in psychotic disorders; refusal to go outside without a trusted companion in agoraphobia; worries about ill health or other harm befalling significant others in generalized anxiety disorder; or concerns about having an illness in illness anxiety disorder;

## Etiology

- Genetic and physiological
    - Genetics
        - Run in families (shared environmental factors?)
    - [[Temperament]] and [[Brain]] Structure/Function
        - High stress reactivity may be **heritable**
        - Behavioural inhibited (BI) children show avoidance of others and atypical [[autonomic nervous system]] responses
        - BI may be due to abnormal functioning in the [[Amygdala]]
- Environmental
    - Prenatal Risks
        - Elevated levels of **cortisol** in the mother during pregnancy
            - May be associated with lower socioeconomic status
        - Makes baby over react for novel stimulus
    - Psychosocial risk factors
        - **Learn to fear by observing** fear reactions in their parents
        - `Conditioning experiences -> avoidant behavior -> fear + anxiety`
        - Parental overprotection and intrusiveness may be associated with separation anxiety disorder.
    - Trauma
        - Separation anxiety disorder often develops after life stress, especially a loss
- Gene-environmental interactions
    - Behavioural inhibition, amygdala dysfunction (**predisposition**) combined with a conditioned fear experience (**environment**)
        - Children with weaker inhibition functioning are easier to develop anxiety

## Prognosis

-  `Heterotypic > Homotypic`
    - Heterotypic: Comorbidity with [[Major Depressive Disorder]]
    - Homotypic: can develop different kind of [[anxiety disorders]]
- Homotypic continuity of anxiety disorders
- $1/3$ will develop [[Generalized Anxiety Disorder|GAD]] + [[Major Depressive Disorder|Depression]] + [[Substance Use Disorder]] problems

## Treatment

1. [[Cognitive Behavioural Therapy|CBT]]
    - `Reframe anxious thoughts -> assertive behaviours`
    - Enhance self-efficacy, **exposure** to reduce avoidance + extinguish fear responses
2. Pharmacological treatments
    - SSRI + CBT
        - SSRI: numbness, 治标不治本
    - Tricyclic antidepressants and benzodiazepines (common, but efficacy?)

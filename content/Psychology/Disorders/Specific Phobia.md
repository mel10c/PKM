> ------------------------------------------------------------
> Characterized by an extreme, unreasonable, and irrational **fear** associated with a specific object, situation, or concept which poses little or no actual danger
>
> ------------------------------------------------------------

## Symptoms

- Marked and **persistent** fear and **avoidance** of a **specific object or situation**
- **Excessive** and disproportionate fear
- Must **interfere** significantly with the personâ€™s life

### Prevalence

- $12.1\%$ of the population had a diagnosable specific phobia in a given year
- $18.4\%$ of the population could expect to develop a specific phobia at some point in their lives
- `Female > Male` in general
    - Animal, situational phobia
- Injection phobia: female = male

## Diagnosis

- (A) Marked **fear or anxiety about a specific object or situation** (e.g., flying, heights, animals, receiving an injection, seeing blood).
    - Note: In children, the fear or anxiety may be expressed by crying, tantrums, freezing, or clinging.
- (B) The phobic object or situation almost always provokes immediate fear or anxiety.
- (C) The phobic object or situation is actively avoided or endured with intense fear or anxiety.
- (D) The fear or anxiety is out of proportion to the actual danger posed by the specific object or situation and to the sociocultural context.
- (E) The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is persistent, typically lasting for 6 months or more.
- (F) The fear, anxiety, or avoidance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
- (G) The disturbance is not better explained by the symptoms of another mental disorder, including fear, anxiety, and avoidance of situations associated with panic-like symptoms or other incapacitating symptoms (as in agoraphobia): objects or situations related to obsessions (as in obsessive-compulsive disorder); reminders of traumatic events (as in posttraumatic stress disorder); separation from home or attachment figures (as in separation anxiety disorder); or social situations (as in social anxiety disorder)

    - [[Little Albert Study]]
- `Non-Associative Model`
    - Biological predisposition for acquiring certain phobias
    - Failure to [[Habituation]] + genetic vulnerability to [[Anxiety]] = Specific Phobia

##### Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder
> ------------------------------------------------------------
> A [[Neurodevelopmental Disorders]] characterised by excessive amounts of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity that are pervasive
>
> ------------------------------------------------------------

## Symptoms

- Motorically and often verbally hyperactive
- Have problems maintaining their focus in conversations and activities
- They show impulsive or erratic behaviour

## Etiology

- Genetics
    - Heritability around $77\%$
    - Brain structures
        - Decrease size ($3-8 \%$ reduction)
        - Abnormalities metabolism of [[Dopamine]] & noradrenergic neurotransmitters
        - Abnormalities of [[Prefrontal Cortex]]
        - Abnormalities of [[Basal Ganglia]]
- Environment
    - Prenatal **toxin exposure**
    - Pregnancy and delivery complications
    - Exposure to **alcohol** and maternal **smoking**
- Interactions

## Diagnosis

- (A). A **persistent pattern** of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that interferes with functioning or development, as characterized by (1) and/or (2):
    1. *Inattention*: **Six (or more)** of the following symptoms have persisted for at least 6 months to a degree that is inconsistent with developmental level and that negatively impacts directly on social and academic/occupational activities:
        - Note: The symptoms are not solely a manifestation of oppositional behavior, defiance, hostility, or failure to understand tasks or instructions. For older adolescents and adults (age 17 and older), at least five symptoms are required.
        1. a. Often fails to give close attention to **details** or makes careless mistakes in schoolwork, at work, or during other activities (e.g., overlooks or misses details, work is inaccurate).
        2. b. Often has difficulty sustaining **attention** in tasks or play activities (e.g., has difficulty remaining focused during lectures, conversations, or lengthy reading).
        3. c. Often does **not seem to listen** when spoken to directly (e.g., mind seems elsewhere, even in the absence of any obvious distraction).
        4. d. Often does not follow through on **instructions** and fails to finish schoolwork, chores, or duties in the workplace (e.g., starts tasks but quickly loses focus and is easily sidetracked).
        5. e. Often has difficulty **organizing** tasks and activities (e.g., difficulty managing sequential tasks; difficulty keeping materials and belongings in order; messy, disorganized work; has poor time management; fails to meet deadlines).
        6. f. Often avoids, dislikes, or is reluctant to engage in tasks that require sustained **mental effort** (e.g., schoolwork or homework; for older adolescents and adults, preparing reports, completing forms, reviewing lengthy papers).
        7. g. Often **loses things** necessary for tasks or activities (e.g., school materials, pencils, books, tools, wallets, keys, paperwork, eyeglasses, mobile telephones).
        8. h. Is often easily **distracted** by extraneous stimuli (for older adolescents and adults, may include unrelated thoughts).
        9. i. Is often **forgetful** in daily activities (e.g., doing chores, running errands; for older adolescents and adults, returning calls, paying bills, keeping appointments).
    2. *Hyperactivity* and *impulsivity*: **Six (or more)** of the following symptoms have persisted for at least 6 months to a degree that is inconsistent with developmental level and that negatively impacts directly on social and academic/occupational activities: Note: The symptoms are not solely a manifestation of oppositional behavior, defiance, hostility, or a failure to understand tasks or instructions. For older adolescents and adults (age 17 and older), at least five symptoms are required.
        1. a. Often fidgets with or **taps hands or feet** or squirms in seat.
        2. b. Often **leaves seat** in situations when remaining seated is expected (e.g., leaves his or her place in the classroom, in the office or other workplace, or in other situations that require remaining in place).
        3. c. Often **runs about** or climbs in situations where it is inappropriate. (Note: In adolescents or adults, may be limited to feeling restless.)
        4. d. Often unable to play or engage in leisure activities **quietly**.
        5. e. Is often “**on the go**,” acting as if “driven by a motor” (e.g., is unable to be or uncomfortable being still for extended time, as in restaurants, meetings; may be experienced by others as being restless or difficult to keep up with).
        6. f. Often talks **excessively**.
        7. g. Often **blurts out** an answer before a question has been completed (e.g., completes people’s sentences; cannot wait for turn in conversation).
        8. h. Often has **difficulty waiting** his or her turn (e.g., while waiting in line).
        9. i. Often **interrupts** or intrudes on others (e.g., butts into conversations, games, or activities; may start using other people’s things without asking or receiving permission; for adolescents and adults, may intrude into or take over what others are doing).
- (B). Several symptoms were present **prior to age 12 years**.
- (C). Several inattentive or hyperactive-impulsive symptoms are present in **two or more settings** (e.g., at home, school, or work; with friends or relatives; in other activities).
- (D). There is clear evidence that the symptoms **interfere** with, or reduce the quality of, social, academic, or occupational **functioning**.
- (E). The symptoms do not occur exclusively during the course of schizophrenia or another psychotic disorder and are not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., mood disorder, anxiety disorder, dissociative disorder, personality disorder, substance intoxication or withdrawal).

## Prognosis

- $2/3$ of the children with ADHD lose diagnosis into adulthood
    - Due to development in the [[Prefrontal Cortex]]

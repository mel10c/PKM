- Physical features
    - These include short stature
    - Slanted eyes with an epicanthic fold of skin over the inner corner
    - A wide and flat bridge of the nose

## Diagnosis 

## Etiology

- Type 1 - `Trisomy 21` in $95\%$ of cases
    - Extra chromosome on pair 21
    - Larger proportion occurring in older mothers
    - May increase when the father is over 40, regardless of the motherâ€™s age
- Type 2 - `Translocation` in $4\%$ of cases
    - Part of the twenty-first chromosome breaks off and attaches to another (not associated with maternal age)
- Type 3 - `Mosaicism` in $1\%$ of cases
    - Cell division occurs unevenly, so that some cells have 45 chromosomes and some have 47
        - May have fewer physical characteristics, better speech, and higher intellectual functioning, depending on the number of cells affected

## Prognosis

- Higher risk for Alzheimertype dementia

The word [psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology) derives from the Greek word *psyche*, for spirit or soul. 

The earliest known reference to the word psychology in English was by Steven Blankaart in 1694 in The Physical Dictionary: "Anatomy, which treats the Body, and Psychology, which treats of the Soul."

`Harry Harlow's Monkey's`
- **Experiment for the role that social relationships(*maternal* [[Relationships]]) play in *early* development**

---


# Method

1. Social isolation -  Infant rhesus monkeys were taken away from their mothers and raised in a laboratory setting, with some infants placed in separate cages away from peers.
2. Two "mother choice" - Harlow took infant monkeys from their biological mothers and gave them two inanimate surrogate mothers:
3. Two conditions: 
    1. The *wire mother* had a **food** and the *cloth mother* did **not**
    2. The *cloth mother* had the **food** while the *wire mother* had **none**.

# Result

- Harlow found that the infant monkeys spent **significantly more time with the terry cloth mother** than they did with the wire mother. 
- When only the wire mother had food, the babies came **to the wire mother to feed** and **immediately returned to cling to the cloth surrogate**.

Thus:
- Close relationships are important to providing **psychological comfort**
- The impact with not having contact with care giver can bring detrimental consequences

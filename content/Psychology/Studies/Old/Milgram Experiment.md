- **Study focus on the conflict between obedience to authority and personal conscience**

---

# Method

1. Participants were told that this is a learning experiment
2. The experimenter (E) orders the teacher (T), the participants, to give what (T) believes are painful electric shocks to a learner (L) who actually is an actor.
    - T cannot see L
3. Each "wrong" answer, (L) receive a shot, and voltage increase (end is dangerously high)
4. Through the study, (L) says they are not feeling well (heart problems), then stop responding
5. If (T) refuse to continue (E) says:
    - "Please continue"
    - "The experiment requires to you to continue"
    - "It is absolutely essential for you to continue"
    - "You have no other choice, you must continue"

# Result

- $65\%$ of participants followed the instructions all the way to the end

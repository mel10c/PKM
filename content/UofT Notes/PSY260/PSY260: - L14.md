- `PDF`:
- [[Memory Processes]]: Encoding, Consolidation and Retrieval
    - What (2) **strategies** are effective and not effective for memory `encoding`?
        - Effective:
            1. Relation [[law of Association|association]] to prior knowledge
            2. Understanding of the concept (depth of processing)
                - Low-level processing is harder to encode
                - High-level processing is easier to encode
        - Not effective: simple repetition
    - What does hippocampus play in memory `consolidation`?
        - [[Memory Processes#^c45b78|Systematic Consolidation]]
        - How can [[Electroconvulsive therapy|ECT]] effect reconsolidation?
            - Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) severely disrupts recently-acquired memories in humans (and animals)
    - What did [[Testing Effect]] suggest about memory `retrival`?
        - Active recalling (practice test) increase recall accuracy
        - *Desirable difficulty*: difficult but successful retrievals are better for memory than easier successful retrievals
        - `More cues -> Better recall` (less difficulty)
- Brain Substrates
    - Where are the [[Semantic Memory]] stored in the brain?
        - [[Semantic Memory]] memories seem to be stored in a distributed fashion throughout the [[Brain#Telencephalon|cerebral cortex]]
            - [[Sensory Cortex]] stores sensory information
            - [[Association Cortex]] links sensory memories together
            - Different groups of neurons with complex **receptive fields** are found throughout the cortex
                - A network of neurons [[Hebbian Learning|fire together]] at once to represent a specific image, such as a face
    - Which area of the brain is [[Memory Processes#Consolidation|Consolidation]] depended on
        - Depend on the [[Medial Temporal Lobe|MTL]], especially [[Hippocampus]]
        1. Standard consolidation theory
            - During learning, the MTL **relays information to the cortex**
            - Over time, the cortex gets the message and the memories become independent of the MTL
        2. Multiple memory trace theory
            - The MTL helps **organize** together the distributed **semantic facts into specific episodic memories**
            - True episodic memories are never fully independent of the MTL
    - What does the [[Frontal Lobe]] play in [[Memory Processes#Consolidation|Consolidation]]?
        - Selecting information to be encoded into [[long term memory]]
        - It may suppress [[Hippocampus|hippocampal activity]] to inhibit memory
- What does sleep contribute to [[Memory Processes#Consolidation|Consolidation]]?
    - Cells in the hippocampus "replay" the the activity of memory during the day
    - Reactivation is important for consolidating important memories throughout the cortex (and not consolidating unimportant memories)
- How does LTP in the [[Hippocampus]] affect memory

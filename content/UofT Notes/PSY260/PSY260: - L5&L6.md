- What are the 2 major non-associative learnings?
    - | Habituation | Sensitization |
        |-----------|---------------|
        | Decrease behaviour | Increase behaviour |
        | Innocuous stimulus | Noxious stimulus |
        | Repeated exposure | Single trial (more helps) |
        | Stimulus specific | Generalizes |
    - [[Habituation]]:
        - `Acoustic Startle Response`
            - Independent variable: time/trials
            - Dependent variable: mouse's startle response
        - Characteristics
            - Stimulus specific
            - What is dishabituation and difference between spontaneous recovery?
                - *Dishabituation*: novel stimulus can lead to **recovery** of responses after an individual has habituated to familiar stimuli; connected to *stimulus specific* characteristic (some generalization, but very small)
                - *Spontaneous recovery* Reappearance (or increase in strength) of a previously habituated response after a short period of no stimulus presentation
                - Dishabituation require **another stimulus** recovery does not
            - Long Term Formation: `Repetition -> Lasting`
            - Spaced Repetition: `Breaks between reppetition -> slow & lasting habituation`
            - Intensity:
                - `Strong stimulus -> less habituation`
                - `Weaker sitmulus -> more habituation`
    - [[Sensitization]]
        - What is the difference between sensitization and [[Classical Conditioning]]?
            - Sensitization Stimulus is **not paired** with the bell (difference with Classical Conditioning)
            - Difference between sensitization and Classical Conditioning is **timing** with stimulus
        - What is the difference between sensitization and dishabituation?
            - Does not need to be noxious stimulation
            - Dishabituation is a **recovery** to **normal baseline** response when the animal receives a different environmental stimulus
            - Sensitization is an **increase** in the magnitude of the response **above the original baseline**
        - Long term effect for sensitization
            - More synapses
        - Effect for serotonin (stabilizer or excitation)?
            - Serotonin does not only do one thing, it can be stabilizer or it can be an excitation does. It depends on what area of the brain it is effecting
- What are the two major theories with non-associative learning?
    - [[Dual process theory]]: Proposes that behavioral changes caused by repeated exposures to a stimulus reflect the **combined effects** of habituation and sensitization
    - *Opponent Process Theory*: a way for organisms to maintain emotional stability
        - Two emotional processes: one that is pleasurable and one that is less pleasant
        - Repeated experiences have different effects on the initial reaction versus the rebound reaction, causing the initial response to habituate faster than the rebound
- What is the difference between familiarity and priming?
    - Familiarity requires conscious sense; priming does not
    - *Familiarity*
        - Exposure based learning
        - An organism typically responds more to a novel stimulus than to a stimulus it was **previously exposed** to, providing evidence of .
    - *Priming*:
        - Exposure to a stimulus, even **without a conscious memory** of that exposure, affects the organism’s response to the stimulus later
- What is the difference between perceptual learning and statistical learning?
    - Perceptual learning requires explicit training; statistical does not
    - *Perceptual learning*:
        - Repeated experiences with a set of stimuli improve the organism’s ability to **distinguish those stimuli**
    - *Statistical learning*
        - Learning driven by repeated exposures to perceptual events that increases the familiarity and distinctiveness of those events.
- How can you explain perceptual learning by the [[Dual process theory]]
    - Exposure to shared features among stimulus would cause one to habituate twice
    - Exposure to unique features of stimulus would only habituate once
    - Thus, the unique features are habituated less, making it more likely to provoke response
- *Spatial learning*
    - Involves latent learning about features of the environment (including encountered objects) through exploration
    - Related to [[Cognitive map]] by Tolman
    - [[Hippocampus]]
        - The hippocampus has *place cells*: cells whose receptive field seems to be a **particular location** or place that is familiar ^c66d8b
        - *Grid cells*: receive inputs from place cells, creating a cognitive map
- Mechanisms for habituation
    - [[Aplysia Withdrawal Reflex]]
    - Repeated exposure will cause [[Synapse#^313ebe|synaptic depression]]
    - In long-term habituation, some sensory-motor synapses actually [[Pruning|pruned]] away
    - Habituation is *homosynaptic* (occurring in one synapse without affecting nearby synapses.)
- Mechanisms for sensitization
    - [[Aplysia Withdrawal Reflex]]
    - Repeated exposure activate interneuron carrying [[neuromodulators]] such as [[Serotonin]]
        - Serotonin increase the glutamate vesicles available
    - Cause action potential to fire at a stronger response
    - Sensitization is *heterosynaptic* (involves changes in several synapses)
    - Calcium channels respond to the action potentials, but they don't contribute to the activation of the action potentia
- Mechanisms for perceptual learning
    - *Sensory Cortex*: input from senses relay to specific locations in the sensory cortex
    - *Receptive field*: neuron within the cortex has a distinct field to receive from
    - *Cortical plasticity*: refinement in the receptive fields of neurons of the sensory cortex due to development or experience

## Question

- Autism disorder are more sensitive and more likely to respond to repeated noise exposure, is this a dysfunction in their habituation process?
    - https://doi.org/10.1007/s10803-020-04780-1
- Will duel process learning be on the test?
- Research what rate experiment with the place cell
    - what the experiment is trying to multipulate

1. The general term for conditions involving severe memory loss is (). More specifically, loss of the ability to form new declarative memories is called (), while the loss of previously acquired information is called ().[^1]
2. Three ways in which memory can be tested are free recall, which entails (); cued recall, which entails (); and recognition, which entails (). Of the three, () usually produces the best performance.[^2]
3. The “() effect” refers to the phenomenon that memory is usually best when the cues available at testing are similar to those at encoding; the “() effect” refers to the phenomenon that memory is usually best when information is processed in the same way at encoding and retrieval.[^3]
4. In the () paradigm, subjects typically show worse memory for items that they have been specifically instructed to forget.[^4]
5. Newly acquired episodic and semantic memories are particularly vulnerable during the (). However, each time a memory is reactivated or recalled, it may again become vulnerable to modification, a process termed ().[^5]
6. () occurs in some forms of amnesia when patients, asked to remember past events, respond with highly detailed but false memories.[^6]
7. () is memory for facts and information about the world (including personal information); () is memory for specific events that occurred at a particular time and place.[^7]
8. The () is located in the medial temporal lobe of the brain and is connected to subcortical structures such as the () by a fiber bundle called the ().[^8]
9. A false memory is ()[^9]
10. Areas of the cerebral cortex involved in processing specific types of information, such as sights and sounds, are called (); other areas of the cortex, called (), process information both within and among sensory modalities.[^10]
11. The Ribot gradient describes a pattern of memory loss in which () memories are more prone to disruption than are () memories.[^11]
12. () is a sudden memory loss that does not seem to result from physical causes such as brain injury.[^12]
13. During periods of (), neurons in the hippocampus “replay” the same activation patterns that they showed during prior learning.[^13]
14. Therapy involving () is sometimes used to treat severe depression but can severely disrupt newly formed memories.[^14]
15. Whereas () memory includes information we are aware that we know, () memory can exist without the learner’s awareness.[^15]
16. Severe and permanent amnesia can be caused by brain damage that includes the () or the ().[^16]
17. () refers to a disruption of memory due to overlap with the content of other memories. In (), new learning disrupts old (previously stored) information. In (), old learning interferes with the ability to recall newly learned information.[^17]
18. Feeling-of-knowing and judgment-of-learning phenomena are examples of (), the knowledge of, and ability to think about, our memories.[^18]
19. Episodic memory and semantic memory are sometimes grouped together in the category (), whereas other types of memory, such as skill memory, that are not always consciously accessible or easy to verbalize are sometimes grouped together in the category ().[^19]
20. () is a transient or temporary disruption of memory that typically includes both anterograde and retrograde amnesia.[^20]
21. Standard consolidation theory states that brain structures including () the are required for storage and retrieval of () memories but not of () memories. In contrast, multiple trace theory suggests that ().[^21]
22. Remembering a fact but thinking you learned it in school when you actually only saw it in a movie is an example of a ().[^22]


# Lecture

- `PDF`:
- Features of [[Episodic Memory]] and [[Semantic Memory]]
    - What are the 2 similarities and 3 differences between episodic and semantic memory?
        - ![[Explicit Memory#Semantic vs. Episodic]]
    - Which system first
        1. Theory 1: `semantic -> episodic`
            - Only after enough semantic info were learned then can episodic been remembered
        2. Theory 2: `episodic -> semantic`
            - Semantic develop from repeated episodic (specific into general)
- Animal Models
    - Radial arm maze for rodents (`semantic memory`)
        - Navigation directly to food demonstrate flexible use of memory
        - Other possible explanation: `episodic` OR `procedural`
    - Tasty Worm Study with jays (`episodic`)



## Questions

- How similar is case of E.P. and Clive Wearing with [[Alzheimer]]?


[^1]: amnesia, anterograde amnesia, retrograde amnesia, recognition
[^2]: generating requested information from memory, some kind of a prompt or cue to aid recall, picking out/recognizing the correct item.
[^3]: encoding specificity, transfer appropriate processing
[^4]: directed forgetting
[^5]: consolidation period, reconsolidation
[^6]: confabulation
[^7]: Semantic, episodic
[^8]: forebrain, hippocampus, fornix
[^9]: a memory of an event that actually never happened
[^10]: sensory cortex, association cortex
[^11]: recently acquired, older
[^12]: Transient global amnesia
[^13]: slow wave sleep
[^14]: ECT

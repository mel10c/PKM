- What is the Basic paradigms of Classical Conditioning?
    - What are the 4 basic concept of [[Classical Conditioning]]?
        - ![[Classical Conditioning#^368756]]
    - What is the difference between **appetitive and aversive** conditioning?
        - *Appetitive conditioning:* consists of learning to predict something that **satisfies** a desire or an appetite
            - Food and sex are among the most powerful of appetitive `US`s
        - *Aversive conditioning*: new `CS -> CR` reflex helps avoid **noxious** `US`
            - Conditioning in which the US is a **disagreeable** event
            - Many of the procedures used for the experimental study of conditioning are aversive conditioning

        - A form of **aversive conditioning**: `CS -> CR` prepares to avoid `US`
        - Puff of air to eye (`US`) innately produces eyeblink (`UR`)
        - `CS`: a tone or light, comes to produce a gradual eye closure (`CR`)
            - Initially the CS (tone) causes no response
            - The effectiveness of the CS builds gradually over many pairings with the US
            - The `CR` is not exactly the same as the `UR`: it takes place **before** the `US` and can even be different in speed, form, etc
        - Works on rabbits and humans, but takes many trials
    - What is a Conditioned Compensatory Responses
        - *Conditioned Compensatory Response*:  a `CR` that is the opposite of the `UR`, helping to balance/correct for the `US-UR` reflex
        - *Tolerance*: A decrease in reaction to a drug such that larger doses are required to achieve the same effect
        1. Inject adrenaline (US) -> heart rate increase (UR)
        2. Repeat procedure in same **testing chamber (CS)**
        3. Eventually, CS comes to produce a decrease in heart rate (CR) that helps maintain **homeostasis** (balance) against expected adrenaline injection
    - What is Extinction and how it works
        - *Extinction*: the process of reducing a learned response to a stimulus by ceasing to pair that stimulus with another, previously associated stimulus
        - Extinction probably doesnâ€™t erase the CS-US connection, just **inhibits** it
        1. Present the `CS` alone repeatedly
        2. Initially, `CS` evokes strong `CR`s
        3. With repetition, however, `CS` becomes **less effective**, similar to beginning of training

## TB Questions

1. According to Aristotle’s principle of [^1], we form a strong association between peanut butter and jelly because they appear together very often.
2. Plato was a proponent of (), which holds that the bulk of our knowledge is ingrained from birth. His student Aristotle was identified with a school of thought known as (), which claims that our ideas stem from experience. [^2]
3. The belief that the mind and body exist as separate entities is known as (). A believer in this principle (), reasoned that a sensory stimulus and motor response follow a pathway known as the ().[^3]
4. According to Darwin, a trait can evolve through () if it is inheritable, variable, and ().[^4]
5. A contemporary of William James, () proposed that the psychology of memory can be defined precisely through mathematical laws as a rigorous natural science.[^5]
6. How memory deteriorates over time is known as () Measuring how much information is retained at various intervals of time following learning, Ebbinghaus was able to plot a ().[^6]
7. Thorndike referred to the training in which organisms learn to make certain responses in order to obtain or avoid important consequences as (), which is now also known commonly as ().[^7]
8. Emerging in the 1920s, the American approach to learning known as () centered around the argument that psychology should exclusively study observable behaviors.[^8]
9. Although the work of () is no longer considered relevant today, his students and followers carried on toward developing mathematical equations to explain learning.[^9]
10. In ()’s law of (), behaviors that lead to desirable consequences are ()
likely to happen again in the future[^10]
11. Edward Tolman, a neo-behaviorist, argued that his rats, intrinsically motivated to learn the general layout of mazes, had formed (), internal psychological representations of the external world.[^11]
12. Learning that takes place even in the absence of any specific motivation to obtain or avoid important consequences is called ().[^12]

- Linking
    - [[Aristotle]]: Ideas are rules of *association*  ^44485e
		1. Contiguity
		2. Frequency
		3.  Similarity
	- [[William James]] and Memory Networks ^1972c3
		- Memories are **networks** of associations, with similar memories sharing key elements in common.
		- Proposed that these links would be physically formed in the brain (false)
	- [[Ivan Pavlov]]'s Conditioning
		- Measure learning about associations that exist in the world
		- Used [[Classical Conditioning]] to experimentally study the  [[#^44485e|laws of association]]
			- Frequency: strengthen association through **learning curve**
			- Contiguity: stimuli will be **extinguished** when none present
			- Similarity: stimuli can be **generalized**
	- [[Edward Thorndike]] Law few Effect
		- Student of [[William James]]
		- [[Operant Conditioning|Instrumental conditioning]]
		- [[Edward Thorndike]] showed that animals learn to associate given behaviors with desirable or undesirable outcomes.
		- [[Law of Effect]]
			- Most effective when experienced first hand; can still applied with [[Social learning]]
- Nature vs Nurture
    - *Nativist*: humans are shaped primarily by their inherited nature
        - [[Plato]]: born with innate differences in skill and talent
        - René [[Descartes]]: most of knowledge is innate, not form experience
        - **reflex** arc from sensory stimulus to motor response.
    - [[Empiricism|Empiricist]]:
        - Aristotle: knowledge gained through training & experience
        - John Locke and Black Slate
            - Children are blank slates (**tabulae rasae**) to be imprinted upon by experience and learning
            - Focused more about political importance about human equality and equal rights
	- [[Behaviourism]]
		- [[John Watson]]
			- John Watson, a leading early proponent of behaviorism, believed that **all behavior is learned** and the product of our environment.
		- [[B.F. Skinner]]'s Radical behaviorism
			- Believed free will to be an illusion, that our behaviour is driven by learned responses to environmental stimuli
			- [[Law of Effect]]
		- Tolman
			- Showed that `stimulus->response` misses something important
			- Proposed the idea of Cognitive Map and *latent learning*
- Comparing Human
    - Charles Darwin & Theory of Natural Selection
        - Traits must be inheritable, variable, and fit
        - Charles Darwin argued that species evolve when they possess a trait that meets three conditions: it is inheritable, it varies, and it increases the fitness of the individual.
    - Neo-Behaviorism of Edward Tolmam
        - Edward Tolman believed that rats have goals and intentions, much as humans do, such as the goal of finding the exit to a maze and obtaining food. Rats, he argued, are like humans in that they are intrinsically motivated to learn the general layout of mazes by forming what he called a cognitive map, an internal psychological representation of the spatial layout of the external world.
- Universal Laws
    - [[Hermann Ebbinghaus]] and Human Memory Experiments
		- [[Empiricism|Empirical]] & experimental & quantitative Design
		- [[Hermann Ebbinghaus#Memory Models]]
	    - Showed effects of **practice** (# of sessions) and **delay** (time between sessions) that seem general to memory across the animal kingdom
    - Clark Hull and Mathematical Models of Learning [Not covered in Lecture]
		- Showed that learning indeed follows reliable, predictable patterns
		- Attempted to devise formal mathematical models to describe learning.
	- W. K. Estes and Mathematical Psychology [Not covered in Lecture]
		- Student of [[B.F. Skinner]]
		- Built and tested mathematical models of learning that helped explain how random variation is as important to animal and human learning as it is to natural selection in evolution.
		- *Stimulus sampling theory*. A key principle is that random variation (“sampling”) is essential for learning, much as it is essential for the adaptation of species in Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution through natural selection
    - [[George Miller]] and Information Theory
	    - Mathematical *Information Theory*:  a mathematical theory of [[communication]] that provides a precise measure of how much information is contained in a message, based not only on the message itself but also on the listener’s prior knowledge
	    - People’s capacity to make judgments concerning **magnitude** across a range was limited to about **seven alternative values**.
	    - [[Short Term Memory#^584e59|Magical number 7]]
	- The *Connectionist Models* of David Rumelhart ^b03b95
	    - Revived [[William James]]’s connectionist network models of memory but translated them into mathematical models of learning.

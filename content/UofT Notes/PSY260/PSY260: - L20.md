- Infancy through childhood
    - Can children learn before birth? How?
        - Auditory [[Habituation]] for baby in womb
    - What kind of [[Memory]] do infants have?
        - Infants have [[Semantic Memory]]: elicited imitation
        - [[Episodic Memory]] seems to develop more slowly
    - What is the language learning sensitive/critical period?
        - Before 12 years of age, after lose the ability to master due to phonetic discriminations
    - What is the difference between children language learning and adult language learning
        - Children: learn and categories from exposure, gradually categories exposed inputs
        - Adult: apply predisposed categories based on previous experience
- Adolescent, adulthood, old age
    - What is the developmental feature for adolescence? Why?
        - [[Working Memory|WM]] and central executive function
        - *Synaptic changes*: strong synaptogenesis in [[Frontal Lobe]], pruning throughout adulthood
        - *Myelination*: not complete until around 18, especially for frontal cortex
        - *Modulation*: increase in dopamine inputs from the midbrain to frontal cortex
    - What is the manifestation of age in brain?
        - Brain deterioration
        - Decrease neuronal density, synaptic density, moss of brain matter
        - Loss is uneven, frontal cortex show substantial loss
- Genetic basis of learning and memory
    - Tyron Rats
        - Restricted: both poor
        - Normal: significant gap due to intelligence differences
        - Enriched: tiny gap due to intelligence differences
    - Epigenetic: G
        - Gene "turn on" due to environmental canges
- Addiction
    - Definitions
        - *Addiction*: strong habit (compulsion) that is maintained despite known harmful consequences
        - Drug abuse ≠ addiction (depend on legality and dose)
    - How did addiction turn into comulsive
        - Reinforcement
            - Must have had a high level of positive reinforcement while taking it the first time
            - **Incentive Salience**: 
                - Dopamine may be the physiological basis for “wanting” or “motivation”
                - Drug addiction to be excessive amplification specifically of psychological 'wanting', especially triggered by cues, without necessarily an amplification of 'liking'
            - Biological
                - Addictive drugs all lead to **increased DA release** in the *nucleus accumbens* (ventral striatum)
        - Tolerance
            - *Tolerance*: reduced reaction to drug, so that larger doses are required to achieve original effect
            - [[Habituation]]: links between what happens in the brain during habituation and what happens through tolerance
            - [[Operant Conditioning]]: Experienced crack cocaine users show conditioned compensatory response to placebo crack
                - Conditioned compensatory response
                    - A CR that is the opposite of the UR
                    - Automatic response that is opposite to the effect of alcohol or substance usage.
        - Withdrawal
            - *Withdraw*: After taking a drug for a prolonged period of time (whether addicted to that drug or not), a period of withdrawal occurs, during which the opposite effects of the drug are experienced
            - Negative reinforcement associated with continued use to avoid withdrawal

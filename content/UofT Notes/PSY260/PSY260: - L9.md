1. The relationship between a US and a UR does/does not involve learning[^1]
2. In eyeblink conditioning, the blink is both a(n) () and a(n) () , although they differ in their ().[^2]
3. In most conditioning paradigms, extinction is faster/slower than the original acquisition of the conditioned response.[^3]
- [?] 4. () conditioned responses in the body are most often the result of a biological mechanism called ()[^4]
5. Evidence that extinction is more than just unlearning comes primarily from studies that look at shifts in () between learning and testing.[^5]
6. When two cues compete to predict a US or other outcome, the one that is most strongly learned is usually the cue that is learned (), as revealed in studies of blocking.[^6]
7. Latent inhibition cannot be explained by the Rescorla–Wagner model because during pre-exposure, there is no ().[^7]
8. Beneath the () cells of the cerebellar cortex lie the cerebellar deep nuclei, including the () nucleus. [^8]
9. CS information travels up to the deep nuclei of the cerebellum along axon tracts called the ()[^9]
10. An airpuff US to the eye activates neurons in the () a structure in the lower part of the brainstem[^10]
11. Purkinje cells (inhibit/excite) the interpositus nucleus, the major output pathway driving the conditioned motor response. [^11]
12. Animals with lesions to the cerebellum show CRs, but they are ()[^12]
13. Latent inhibition and other expressions of CS modulation are impaired or eliminated by lesions to the . ()[^13]
14. The neural mechanism for habituation is thought to be a progressive decrease in the number of vesicles containing the neurotransmitter () neuron’s axon.[^14]
15. The () of the sensory neuron’s release of glutamate onto the motor neuron is a presynaptic form of  ()[^15]
16. Two proteins found inside neurons play critical regulatory roles in the synapse-creation process. The first protein, CREB-1, activates genes in the neuron’s nucleus that () the growth of new synapses. The second protein, CREB-2, () the actions of CREB-1. [^16]
17. Rats can be protected from overdose by the () they acquired through the administration of lower doses of heroin in the same setting[^17]
18. Appealing because of its simplicity, the () model has served as a starting point for many promising models of learning[^18]
19. The learning that takes place in order to avoid or minimize the consequences of expected aversive events is known as [^19]

    - Basis of Learning
        - Amount of Training Matters
            - Small amount of training -> short-term memory
            - Repeated CS-US pairings -> long-term memory lasting weeks, days
        - With repeated training, proteins are activated and return to the nucleus to alter which genes are activated, resulting in the release of different proteins:
            - CREB-1, activated and promotes growth of new synapses
            - CREB-2, deactivated, as it inhibits growth of new synapses
            - Long-term learning depends on activation of genes to promote brain re-wiring



## Questions

- Possible office hour discussion
    - Professor in 290 explained that behaviours are mostly innate and experience contribute to how genes are expressed
    - In his opinion, free will is the spontaneous sparks of random events in life, but from what I seem in his class, we seem to make the assumptions that most behaviours are learned, and genes just determines the threshold of how fast/strong the behaviour will be learned
    - How do you view these views

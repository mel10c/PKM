- Expertise
    - What is the [[Pual Fitts|Fitts]]'s three-stage model of skills (motor programs)?
        - *Motor programs*: sequences of movements performed virtually automatically
        - [[Skilled Memory#Three-stage Model of Skill Learning]]
    - What is an expert?
        - An expert is someone who has **mastered a skill** better than most people
        - What type of learning that experts that differs than average?
            - Perceptual learning 
    - How does one become an expert
        - Through extensive [[Practice]]
            - Some estimates indicate a minimum of $10,000$ hours of practice is required for deep expertise in a complex skill
            - Some psychologists maintain that practice alone is sufficient to become an expert in any domain (though perhaps not worldclass)
        - Through *talent* (the ability to master a skill with little effort)
        - Studies of twins confirm that both talent and effort matter
- Brain Substrates
    - [[Basal Ganglia]]
        - Where is basal ganglia located?
            - At the base of the forebrain
        - What communicative functions does basal ganglia do?
            - Inputs throughout the [[Brain#Forebrain|cortex]] `->` [[basal ganglia]] `->` [[Thalamus]] & [[motor cortex]] | [[Brain#Hindbrain/Brainstem|brainstem]]
        - What does basal ganglia differ with hippocampus in learning and memory
            - [[Basal Ganglia]] damage selectively impairs [[Skilled Memory|skill learning]], but not [[episodic memory]]
            - [[Hippocampus]] damage impairs [[episodic memory]], but not [[Skilled Memory|skill learning]]
            - Thus, basal ganglia is particularly important **in forming new skill memories**
                - It is unclear if the basal ganglia are involved in consolidation of skill memory, storage, or both; also lesion effects on skill learning could be due to movement problems, not specific to learning
        - How does skill practice show in cortical level
            - Skill practice **expands the amount of cortical space** dedicated to representing skill-related sensations and movements
    - [[Cerebellum]]
        - What does impairment in the cerebellum affect learning and object tracing
            - Patients with cerebellar damage take twice as long to trace images compared with controls
            - Rate of learning similar to controls
        - What is the effect of lateralization?
            - Left cerebellum activity decreases
            - Right cerebellum activity increase

- [[Nonverbal Communication]]
    - Nonverbal communication serves vital functions, ***providing information***, **regulating interaction**, and **defining the nature of the relationship** two people share.
    - Components of Nonverbal Communication.
        - *Facial expression*:
            - Facial expressions are good guides to others’ moods, but cultural norms influence expressive behavior.
        - *Gazing behavior*:
            - The direction and amount of a person’s looking is important in defining relationships and in regulating interaction. In addition, our pupils dilate when we’re seeing something that interests us.
        - *Body movement*:
            - Gestures vary widely across cultures, but the posture and motion of the entire body are informative as well.
        - *Touch*:
            - Different types of touch have distinctly different meanings.
        - *Interpersonal distance*:
            - We use different zones of personal space—the intimate, personal, social, and public zones—for different kinds of interactions.
        - *Smell*:
            - Information about one’s emotions is transmitted to others by one’s smell.
        - *Combining the components*:
            - Mimicry occurs when people use similar nonverbal behavior without realizing it. Nonverbal actions allow us to fine-tune the intimacy of our interactions in subtle but real ways.
    - *Nonverbal Sensitivity*:
        - Unhappy spouses, especially husbands, do a poor job at nonverbal communication.
- Verbal [[Communication]]
    - *Self-Disclosure*:
        - Intimacy involves sharing personal information about oneself to one’s partner.
        - *How self-disclosure develops*:
            - As a relationship develops, both the breadth and depth of self-disclosure increase. Intimacy develops when we perceive responsiveness in others that indicates that they understand us and care about us.
        - *Secrets and other things we don’t want to talk about*:
            - Couples avoid taboo topics, and some secrecy is routine even in intimate partnerships.
        - *Self-disclosure and relationship satisfaction*:
            - Appropriate self-disclosure breeds liking and contentment, and expressions of affection are good for us.
    - *Gender Differences in Verbal Communication*: ^be93d0
        - Women are more likely than men to discuss feelings and people, but men and women are equally talkative. However, macho men self-disclose relatively little to other men even when they are friends, and thus are likely to share their most meaningful intimacy only with women.
- Dysfunctional [[Communication]] and What to Do About It
    - *Miscommunication*:
        - Distressed couples have trouble saying what they mean, and they engage in destructive verbal behavior characterized by kitchen-sinking, drifting off-beam, mindreading, interruptions, yes-butting, and cross-complaining. Criticism, contempt, stonewalling, defensiveness, and belligerence are especially corrosive.
    - *Saying What We Mean*:
        - Skillful senders use behavior description, I-statements, and XYZ statements to focus on specific actions and make their feelings clear.
    - *Active Listening*:
        - Good listeners use paraphrasing and perception checking to u stand their partners.
    - *Being Polite and Staying Cool*:
        - Happy couples also avoid extended periods of negative affect reciprocity.
    - *The Power of Respect and Validation*:
        - Partners should communicate respect and recognition of the other’s point of view even when they disagree.
- <u>Suggestions</u>
    - Affectionate touching is good for both you and your partner. Consider doing more of it.
    - Tune in. Pay attention. Watch your partner’s eyes and listen to their paralanguage and strive to discern what they really mean by what they say.
    - Open up. Share your hopes, dreams, and fears with trusted, responsive partners.
    - Ask your partner what they think about the things that are important to you.
    - Tell those you love that you love them.
    - When it matters, don’t text. Talk.
    - Construct complaints carefully. Discard terms such as “always” or “never” and practice the use of XYZ statements.
    - Don’t assume that you understand. Paraphrase and check your perceptions of your partner’s meaning.
    - If you get angry, take a time out. Ask to take a break, go off by yourself, and calm down.
    - Communicate respect for your partner’s opinions whether or not you agree with them.
    - Contempt is caustic. Avoid it at all costs.

### Chapter 3

> Basis of [[Attraction]]: We are attracted to people whose presence is **rewarding** because they offer us _**instrumentality**_, assistance in achieving our goals.

- Proximity: Liking Those Near Us
    - We select our friends, and our enemies, from those around us.
    - *Familiarity: Repeated Contact*:
        - In general, familiarity breeds attraction. Even brief, mere exposure to others usually increases our liking for them.
    - *Convenience: Proximity Is Rewarding, Distance Is Costly*:
        - Relationships with distant partners are ordinarily less satisfying than they would be if the partners were nearby.
    - *The Power of Proximity*:
        - Close proximity makes it more likely that two people will meet and interact, for better or for worse.
- Physical Attractiveness: Liking Those Who Are Lovely
    - Our Bias for Beauty: “What Is Beautiful Is Good.” We assume that attractive people have other desirable personal characteristics.
    - *Who’s Pretty*:
        - Symmetrical faces with features of average dimensions are especially beautiful. Waist-to-hip ratios of 0.7 are very appealing in women, whereas a WHR of 0.9 is attractive in a man if he has money.
    - *An Evolutionary Perspective on Physical Attractiveness*:
        - Cross-cultural agreement about beauty, cyclical variations in women’s desires, and the link between attractiveness and good health are all consistent with the assumptions of evolutionary psychology.
    - *Culture Counts, Too*:
        - Standards of beauty also fluctuate with changing economic and cultural conditions.
    - *Looks Matter*:
        - When people first meet, nothing else affects attraction as much
    - *The Interactive Costs and Benefits of Beauty*:
        - Physical attractiveness has a larger influence on men’s social lives than on women’s. Attractive people doubt the praise they receive from others, but they’re still happier than unattractive people are.
    - *Matching in Physical Attractiveness*:
        - People tend to pair off with others of similar levels of beauty.
- Reciprocity: Liking Those Who Like Us
    - People are reluctant to risk rejection. Most people calculate others’ overall desirability by multiplying their physical attractiveness by their probability of reciprocal liking. People who are desirable partners—that is, those with high mate value—insist that their partners be desirable, too.
- Similarity: Liking Those Who Are Like Us
    - Birds of a feather flock together. People like those who share their attitudes.
    - *What Kind of Similarity*:
        - Happy relationship partners resemble each other in demographic origin, attitudes, and, to a lesser degree, in personalities.
    - *Do Opposites Attract*:
        - Opposites do not attract, but they may seem to for several reasons. First, we are attracted to those who we think are like us, and we can be wrong. Then, it takes time for perceived similarity to be replaced by more accurate understanding of the attributes we share with others. People may be attracted to those who are mildly different from themselves but similar to their ideal selves. People also tend to become more similar over time, and some types of similarity are more important than others. Matching is also a broad process; fame, wealth, talent, and looks can all be used to attract others. Finally, we may appreciate behavior from a partner that differs from our own but that complements our actions and helps us to reach our goals.
    - *So, What Do Men and Women Want*:
        - People evaluate potential partners with regard to (a) warmth and loyalty, (b) attractiveness and vitality, and (c) status and resources. For lasting romances, women want men who are warm and kind and who are not poor, and men want women who are warm and kind and who are not unattractive. Thus, everybody wants intimate partners who are amiable, agreeable, and loving.
- <u>Suggestions for Relationships</u>
    - Proximity is attractive; don’t expect absence to make the heart grow fonder.
    - Don’t be fooled: A dating site that promises to find a perfect partner for you probably won’t.
    - Don’t judge a book by its cover; beauty isn’t talent.
    - Seek friends and lovers with whom you agree on all of the things that are important to you.
    - Join the crowd: Put a potential partner’s warmth and kindness at the top of your list of priorities.

### Chapter 4

> First Impressions (and Beyond): When we first meet others, we jump to conclusions because of **stereotypes** and **[[primacy effect]]**. **[[Confirmation Bias]]** then affect our selection of subsequent data, and overconfidence leads us to put unwarranted faith in our judgments.
- The Power of Perceptions:
    - Partners’ perceptions can be very consequential.
    - *Idealizing Our Partners*:
        - Happy partners construct positive illusions that emphasize their partners’ virtues and minimize their faults.
    - *Attributional Processes*:
        - The explanations we generate for why things happen are called attributions. Partners are affected by actor/observer effects and self-serving biases, and they tend to employ either relationship-enhancing or distress-maintaining patterns of attribution.
    - *Memories*. We edit and update our [[Memory]] as time goes by:
        - This process of reconstructive memory helps couples stay optimistic about their futures.
    - *Relationship Beliefs*:
        - Our assumptions about the role marriage will play in our lives take the form of marital paradigms. Dysfunctional relationship beliefs such as destiny beliefs are clearly disadvantageous. Growth beliefs are more realistic and profitable.
    - *Expectations*.
        - Our expectations about others can become self-fulfilling prophecies, false predictions that make themselves come true:
    - *Self-Perceptions*.
        - We seek reactions from others that are self-enhancing and complimentary and that are consistent with what we already think of ourselves—with selfverification leading people to seek intimate partners who support their existing self-concepts.
    - *Nonconscious Social Cognition*.
        - We often have both positive and negative associations with our partners, implicit attitudes, of which we are unaware. We also may not recognize how, through transference, experiences with prior partners can influence our feelings and behavior in current relationships.
- Impression Management
    - We try to influence the impressions of us that others form.
    - *Strategies of Impression Management*.
        - Four different strategies of impression management—ingratiation, self-promotion, intimidation, and supplication—are commonplace.
    - *Impression Management in Close Relationships*.
        - High self-monitors are less committed to their romantic partners, but all of us work less hard to present favorable images to our intimate partners than to others.
- So, Just How Well Do We Know Our Partners?
    - We generally don’t understand our partners as well as we think we do.
    - *Knowledge*.
        - As a relationship develops and partners spend more time together, they typically do understand each other better.
    - *Motivation*.
        - The interest and motivation with which people try to figure each other out help to determine how insightful and accurate they will be.
    - *Partner Legibility*.
        - Some personality traits, such as extraversion, are more visible than others.
    - *Perceiver Ability*.
        - Some judges are better than others, too. Emotional intelligence is important in this regard.
    - *Threatening Perceptions*.
        - However, when accurate perceptions would be worrisome, intimate partners may actually be motivated to be inaccurate.
    - *Perceiver Influence*.
        - Perceptions that are initially inaccurate may become more correct as we induce our partners to become the people we want them to be.
- <u>Suggestions for relationships</u>
    - Humility is attractive. Strive to be humble instead of overconfident in your judgments of others.
    - Celebrate your partner’s virtues and acknowledge, but do not dwell, on their faults.
    - Blame less; remember that nearly all of the annoyances and inconveniences a loving partner causes you are unintended.
    - Accept more personal responsibility for the setbacks you encounter in your relationships.
    - Love, all by itself, does not conquer all. Adopt the perspective that successful relationships require creative collaboration, compromise, and effort.
    - Remember that people behave the way they do around you due in part to the way you behave toward them.
    - Don’t overestimate your ability to change a potential partner’s negative self-concept.
    - Don’t get lazy. Continue to work hard to make good impressions on your friends and lovers.
    - Recognize that you don’t understand your partners as well as you think you do. Actively strive to know and understand them better.

# Active Studying

#### Summarize today's lecture

- [::Most important/focused topic]: [[Attachment]], [[Attraction]]

    - Yes, there is no direct causation for infant/adult attachment, life experience contribute too
- [x] Differences between anticipation of interaction vs. Familiarity?
    - Anticipation interaction focus on **expectation** due to evolution
    - Familiarity focus on **preference of familiarity** due to perceptual processing

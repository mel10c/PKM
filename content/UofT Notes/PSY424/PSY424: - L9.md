### Conflict, Stress & Power

- ==Peterson’s General Model of Conflict==: `Beginging ==[Engagement]==> Middel ==> Termiantion`
- Beginnings: 
    - *Predisposing factors* – increase likelihood of conflict
        - Conflict of interest, situational stress, emotion and mood, personality, attachment style, stage in life
    - *Instigating events*: Interference with goal-directed action
        - Criticism, illegitimate demands, rebuffs, cumulative annoyances
    - *Engagement* vs. *Avoidance*
        - Engagement: Issue perceived as significant but solvable
        - Avoidance: Issue perceived as trivial or insolvable, `conflict end`
- Middle
    - <a style="color:#a3be8c">Negotiation</a> vs. <a style="color:#bf616a">Escalation</a>

- Termination
    - **Negotiation** and **separation** and lead to immediate termination
    - <a style="color:#bf616a">Domination</a>: capitulation
    - <a style="color:#a3be8c">Compromise</a>: interests diluted rather than resolved
    - <a style="color:#a3be8c">Integrative agreement</a>: win-win for current issue
    - <a style="color:#a3be8c">Structure agreement</a>: win-win, and prevention for future conflict (hardest but best)
- Dual-concern theory

### Relationship Stress

- Rejection
    - *Relational devaluation*: depends on levels of acceptance and/or rejection
    - Early rejection experiences have long term effects
    - Reason for rejection: need to belong, feelings of self-worth, perceptions of control
    - Responses
        - `Behavioural` response
            - **Self-defeating behaviours** (Procrastination), less self-control, more aggression
            - Prosocial behavioural (自卑？讨好式社交？)
        - `Cognitive` response
            - **Deconstructed states** (lack of meaning and control), less intelligent thought, more attention to social information
        - `Emotional` response
            - Confusion, **hurt feelings**, sadness, anger, anxiety
    - Ostracizes: justification for behaviour, damaging the relationship
    - Criticism: reduce felt security
- Jealousy
    - Definition: Potential loss of a valued relationship to a real or imagined rival
    - 2 Types
        1. Reactive jealousy: awareness of an actual threat to a valued relationship
        2. Suspicious jealousy: one’s partner has not been misbehaving and one’s suspicions do not fit the facts
- Betrayal
    - Definition: any act that violates the norms of benevolence, loyalty, respect and trustworthiness within a relationship

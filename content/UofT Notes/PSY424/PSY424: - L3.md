> *Interdependency*: which exists when we need others and they need us in order to obtain valuable interpersonal rewards.

- Social Exchange
    - [[Interdependence theory]] offers an economic view of relationships that involves **social exchange** in which partners provide each other **desirable rewards**.
    - *Rewards and Costs*:
        - Rewards are gratifying and costs are punishing. The net profit or loss from an interaction is its outcome.
    - *What Do We Expect from Our Relationships*:
        - People have *comparison levels $CLs$* that reflect their **expectations** for their interactions with others. When the outcomes they receive exceed their CLs, they’re satisfied, but if their outcomes fall below their CLs, they’re discontent.
    - *How Well Could We Do Elsewhere*:
        - People also judge the **outcomes** available elsewhere using a comparison level for alternatives $CL_{alt}$. When the outcomes they receive exceed their CL_alt, they can’t do better elsewhere, and they’re dependent on their current partners.
    - *Four Types of Relationships*:
        - Comparing people’s $CL$s and $CL_{alt}$s with their outcomes yields four different relationship states: happy and stable; happy and unstable; unhappy and stable; and unhappy and unstable.

    - *$CL$ and $CL_{alt}$ as Time Goes By*:
        - People adapt to the outcomes they receive, and relationships can become less satisfying as the partners’ CLs rise. Cultural influences shape both our expectations and our CLalt s.
- The Economies of Relationships
    - Counting up the rewards and costs of a relationship provides extraordinary information about its current state and likely future.
    - *Rewards and Costs Are Different*:
        - An *approach motivation* leads us to seek **rewards**, an *avoidance motivation* leads us to **avoid costs**, and the extent to which each is fulfilled defines different relationship states. ^320b90
    - *Rewards and Costs as Time Goes By*:
        - A ==relational turbulence model== suggests that new relationships usually encounter a lull when partners adjust to their new status as an established couple. Thereafter, marital satisfaction usually decreases over the first years of marriage. This may be due to the partners’ lack of effort and to the manner in which interdependency magnifies small irritations, and to other routine influences such as unwelcome surprises and unrealistic expectations. Insight may forestall or prevent these problems.
- Are We Really This Greedy?
    - Both the **quality** of outcomes one receives and **underbenefit**, when it occurs, determine how happy and stable a relationship will be.
    - *The Nature of Interdependency*:
        - Interdependent partners have a stake in keeping each other happy. As a result, generosity toward one’s partner is often beneficial to oneself.
    - *Exchange versus Communal Relationships*:
        - *Exchange* relationships are governed by a desire for immediate repayment of favors
        - *Communal* relationships involve more selfless concern for another’s needs.
    - *Equitable Relationships*:
        - **Equity** occurs when both partners gain benefits from a relationship that are proportional to their contributions to it.
        - According to ==equity theory==, people dislike inequity. However, overbenefit is not always associated with reduced satisfaction with a relationship—but underbenefit is.
    - *Some People Are Greedier Than Others*:
        - *Maximizers* seek to optimize their outcomes; they remain attentive to their alternative options and so are routinely less committed to their current partners than satisficers are.
- The Nature of Commitment
    - *Commitment* is a desire to continue a relationship, and the willingness to maintain it. When people are high in commitment readiness, they commit more completely. The investment model asserts that satisfaction, the quality of one’s alternatives, and the size of one’s investments influence commitment. However, there may be three kinds of commitment: **personal, constraint, and moral**.
    - *The Consequences of Commitment*:
        - Committed people take action to protect and maintain their relationships, being accommodating, making sacrifices willingly, and derogating others who might lure them away from their relationships.

        - [[Economics]]
    - What did [[social exchange theory]] propose?
        - All participants in social interactions pursue self-interest by **exchanging** social goods
        - Assume rational decision on always maximizing reward and minimizing cost
        - Assume choice is made in ones' **own** interest (self-centred)
    - What is [[Interdependence theory]] about?

            - What are some complexities in the calculation of outcome
                - Rewards/cost are not equal, research suggest that the ratio is closer to $1:5$ (5 rewards for 1 cost)
        2. [[Interdependence theory#^210eee|Comparison level]]
        3. [[Interdependence theory#^d13141|Comparison level for alternatives]]
            - Higher dependency `--> ` lower power
        - What is the key difference between $CL$  and $CL_{ALT}$?
            - $CL$: focus on *satisfaction* (more emotional, psychological determined, happy or not)
            - $CL_{ALT}$: focus on *dependency* (leave or stay)
        - Why is $CL_{ALT}$ hard to calculate in real world?
            - $CL_{ALT}$ increase with **desirability and availability** of alternative partners OR solitude
            - *Barriers* (factors outside of a relationship that act to keep partners together ex. culture belief)

            - Initial level will [[Habituation|habituate]], **expectation** change
        - $CL_{ALT}$: fluctuate with [[Culture|cultural]] changes and experience
            - Love is a recent culture value, social media increase alternative comparison levels
            - More likely to notice alternatives if currently unhappy about relationship status
        - Costs
            - [[Intimate relationship]] seems to involve more costs
                - Closer the relationship `-->` higher chance of notice

                - *Negative bias*
            - What intimate partners [[Communication|communicate]] during disagreements
                - Higher knowledge `-->` greater chance for emotional/psychological damage
            - Disagreement between partners about meaning and value of rewards
                - Closer relationship `-->` greater impact with disagreements
            - Rewards and costs have different, **separate effects** on relationship well-being

            - Absence: **dangerous, threatening**
        - Can co-exist
        - Different people have different levels of approach motivation vs avoidance motivation
    - How does rewards & Costs change over time?
        - Satisfaction increase `<===>` level of involvement increase (beginning)
        - Satisfaction decrease during transition from causal to series involvement
            - Model of Relational Turbulence (Knobloch & Solomon, 2004) proposed period of **adjustment**
                - Adjust to changes in autonomy

    - Define equitable relationships
        - $$ \frac{\text{Your outcomes}}{\text{Your contributions}} = \frac{\text{Partner's outcomes}}{\text{Partner's contributions}} $$
        - Proportional justice: Each partner gains benefits from the relationship that are proportional to his or her contributions
        - Example
            - 
                ```ad-example

# Active Studying

#### Summarize today's lecture

- [::Most important/focused topic]: ==[[Interdependence theory]]==, [[Social Cognition#Cognitive Attributions]]
- [::Most difficult part, why, how to resolve] Distinguishing $CL$ and $CL_{ALT}$
    - $CL$: focus on satisfaction
    - $CL_{ALT}$: focus on dependency

#### What part I didn't understand, next step actions?

- [x] For [[Self-fulfilling prophecies]] examples, is there a circle for dismissing attachment types? Since they also need intimacy, just been suppressed, how would this manifest in self-fulfilling prophecies
    - The pre-existing belief is not there for secure and dismissing attachments
    - Only fearful if not able to suppress the desires
- [x] Differentiate [[Social Exchange Theory]] vs [[Interdependence theory]]
    - Social exchange is a broader topic, lecture focus in interdependence theory

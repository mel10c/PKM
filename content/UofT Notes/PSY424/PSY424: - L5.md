- [[Family]] as theories
    - [[Family#^b873ea|Sullivan Interpersonal Theory]]
        - Provide with first model with interpersonal interactions
    - [[Attachment]]
        - Crucial in how one view themselves and expectation of how to interact with others
        - Contribute to adult relationships
    - [[Psychoanalysis]]
        - Important for personality development ([[Psychoanalysis#Psychosexual Stage Model|psychosexual stages]])
        - Especially important for the first 6 years of life (oral, annal, phallic)
    - [[Alfred Alder]]
        - Parenting in early in life influences feelings of inferiority (contribute to how one strive for superiority)
        - Birth order effects personality
    - [[Theory of Development]]
        - Have fixed psychosocial stages
        - Internal drive vs. External demand
    - [[Ecological System Theory]]
        - Born in the context of broader system
        - Earliest context (family)
- Characteristic 1: Family as systems
    - What is the system theory?
        - A system is a **cohesive** group of **interrelated** and **interdependent** parts
            - Bound by space of time
            - Influence by environment
            - Defined by structure and purpose
            - Expressed through functioning
        - What are the 4 properties of systems
            1. Wholeness
            2. Integrity of subsystems
            3. Circularity of influence
            4. Stability and change
    - How does `wholeness` contribute to systems
        - Argues `Organized whole > Sum of parts`
            - Creates a shared reality (unique)
        - *Synergy*: components working together (members of family)
    - How does `integrity of subgroups` contribute to systems
        - Complex systems are composed of **subsystems** that are related to each other
        - Dyadic relationship in family

            ```
        - All components are **mutually interdependent**
        - Change in one has implications for all others 牵一发而动全身
    - How can `Stability & Change` contribute to family
        - They are affected by all sorts of **outside influences**
        - Each system tries to maintain a state of stability, change tends to be resisted
        - *Disequilibrium*: a situation in which there is a **significant** change in a family member or in a relationship between family members
        - *Phase transition*: a period of transition in a family system in which old patterns are breaking down and new patterns are emerging
- Characteristic 2: Family Structure & Processes
    - Family structure vs. Family processes/functioning
        - Family structure
            - Outward, observable **characteristic** of the family (have face validity)
                - Ex. family size, birth order, family composition
        - Family process
            - **Patterns** of how families interact (difficult to measure)
                - Ex. intimacy, conflict, parenting styles
    - What are the 2 impactful event that changed family structure/functioning?
        - Before this, family was the only source of support, economic, marriage, lived on it
        - Industrialization: 
            - After this, family focused on medical care, psychological care, education, recreation, employment
        - Modernization:
            - After this, family focus on psychological, emotional needs, and ascribed socio-economic status
    - How did industrialization/modernization impact family?
        - Longer life expectancy
        - Economic prosperity and social norms 
            - Employment opportunities

            - Sibling spacing
            - Nuclear vs. extended families

            - The “traditional” nuclear family is no longer the norm to which everyone “must” aspire
- Characteristic 3: Intergenerational Solidarity y (Bengtson, 2001)
    - *Intergenerational Solidarity*
        - The emotional and behavioural dimensions of interactions, cohesion, sentiment, and support among family members over the course of long-time relationships
    - What are the 6 dimensions of ***intergenerational*** solidarity
        1. Affective solidarity
            - **Emotions** expressed/exchanged between generations
            - Sentiments and evaluations family members express about their relationship with other members
        2. Associational solidarity
            - The type and **frequency** of **contact** between intergenerational family members
        3. Consensual solidarity
            - Agreement in **opinions**, values, beliefs, and orientations between generations
        4. Functional solidarity
            - Exchange of **support** (emotional or instrumental)
            - The giving and receiving of support across generations, including both instrumental assets as well as emotional support
            - Type and direction are both important
        5. Normative solidarity
            - **Expectations** regarding filial obligations and parental obligations, as well as norms about the importance of familistic value
        6. Structure solidarity
            - The “**opportunity** structure” for cross-generational interaction reflecting geographic proximity between family members
- Nature & Impacts of Family Transitions
    - How can additional of **partner** impact family?
        - Cohabitation
            - Why does couple cohabitate before marriage has a higher rate to divorce?
                - Selection effect (higher likelihood to cohabitation `<-->` less series about relationships)
                - Culture (more acceptance to cohabitate `<-->` more acceptance for divorce)
            - Alternative to marriage
            - Prelude to marriage
            - Alternative to being single
        - Current trend on marriage
            - Proportion of people who marry is decreasing
            - First marriage age is increasing
            - Reasons
                - Social pressure
                - Less dependency on marriage with living standards 
        - Mental/physical health
            - Selection effect (happier people attract happier people)
            - Provide resources to help well being
            - Marital crisis (marital conflict negatively reduce well being)
            - Remain in unhappy marriage `-->` higher mental/physical risk
        - Gottman & Notarius (2000)
            - Predicting divorce rate

            - Roughly 85% of adults will eventually become parents
            - Declining brith rate among emerging adults
            - Increasing brith rate among women over 40

            - Type of siblings
                - As children mature from childhood to early adolescence sibling conflict increases 
                - Over the course of adolescence sibling relationships become more equal, more distant & less emotionally intense 
                - In adulthood, close, positive sibling relationships can compensate for poor parent-adult child relationships
        - Curvilinear relationship
            - Transition typically accompanied by a small decrease in happiness and marital satisfaction
            - But applicable for all family

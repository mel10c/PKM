- CASA: Cognitive Science and Artificial Intelligence Student's Association
    - Meeting: Sept 15, 12:00 to 15:00

- What is [[Cognitive Science]]
    - The interdisciplinary science study of **mind**
    - **_Mind_**: key distinction of being a person ^86afab
- What are 3 Problems of mind (Cognitive Science is the field to solve these problems)
    1. ★ Problem of **_equivocation_**: use the same word for different things (making argument treading off with different meaning, making the argument non-valid):
        - Ex. `Information`
        - | Definition | Discipline            | Level of Reality       |
        |------------|-----------------------|------------------------|
        | Mind       | *Neuroscience*          | Brain                  |
        | Mind       | [[Computer Science]] (AI) | Machine Learning       |
        | Mind       | [[Psychology]]            | Behaviour & Experiment |
        | Mind       | *Linguistics*           | Language               |
        | Mind       | *Anthropology*          | Culture                |
        | Mind       | [[Philosophy]]            | Using [[Metaphysics\|Ontology]] & [[Epistemology]] creating conceptual vocabulary for theoretical grammar |
    1. Plausible Ignorance: ignoring the fact that all levels of reality that they are **interacted**
    2. Fragmentation: creating [[Nihilism]] for the general public in terms of what they belong (create coherent account of minds)
- What are 3 Vision of Cognitive Science
    1. Generic Nominalism (genus & categorization) `Rejected`
        - Does not solve problems of equivocation
        - JUST creating set of vocabularies and categories in the study
    2. Interdisciplinary eclecticism (折中主义) `Rejected`
        - Unstable (degenerates into generic nominalism)
        - Only brief bridges are built
    3. ★ Synoptic Integration (综合集成)
        - Looking to building strong bridges between disciplines
        - Aims to challenge and change all related fields (solve problems between discipline, not within)
        - Big picture framework: additive processing, 4E cogscience, 4P model
- How do we do Synoptic Integration and how to do it well?
    - **_Metaphor_** (bridging between domains)
        - **Connecting**: *identity* and *insight*
        - [[#^fb6070|Balance]]: keep relevant identity, compare salient insights (adpt-transfer)
        - > [!example]- "Sam is a pig"
          > - `Pig`: (domain of animal) a set of salient characteristics
          > - `Sam`: (domain of human)
          > - Bridging between: using `Pig`'s lens to [[Perception|perceive]] `Sam`
     - *Multi-aptness*: can apply it for many different domains, and transfer deep (elegance)
         - Affords transfer to many different domains
     - *Convergence*: many argument support it (trustworthiness) <span style="color:#a3be8c">Milligram</span>
     - ★ **_Plausibility_**: both elegant and trustworthiness (where one should take seriously) ^fb6070
        - `(trivial) Convergence --- [Balance] --- Elegance (far-fetched)`
        - Liar: depends you care about true
        - Bullshit: depends you care about salience
        - Deepity: equivocating (dual-meaning) between trivial thing with far-fetched thing
            - > [!example]- "Love is just a word"
            > - `Trivial ==> Far-Fetched`: using **dual-meaning** to apply trivial statement to far-fetched applications
            > - Actually doesn't have any evidence (far-fetched statement)
        - Motte and Bailey: far-fetched to trivial
            - > [!example]- "Morality is socially constructed"
            > - `Trial <--> Far-Fetched`: switch between using a trial (defensible & uncontroversial) statement and arguing a far-fetched (controversial) statement
            > - `Motte (trial)`: moral is socially constructed; `Bailey (far-fetched)`: no such things as right or wrong
- What is the purpose of synoptic integration, what is the **3 naturalistic imperative** for cognitive science
    - Human need plausible definition to account for complexity of scientific explanations
    - 3 Naturalistic Imperative
        1. Analysis
            - Thales: "all is the moist"
            - *Plausible* (since his lives were in Greece, surrounded by water)
            - Analysis (analyzing complex phenomenon into basic phenomenon)
            - Lodestone has psyche
        2. Formalization
            - Descartes: "invented Cartesian Plane" (mathematic in the foundation for science)
            - *Formalization* (explain mental in non-mental terms, that is mathematically measurable)
            - Solve: `Homuncular Fallacy` (从前有个山，山里有个庙，庙里有个和尚说“从前有个山...”)
        3. Mechanization
            - Alan Turing (taking the design stand: how would you put it into a machine)
            - *Mechanization* (engineering end run: a machine to simulate the mind)
            - Solve: Hard to study complex mind: always try to please them and deceive them

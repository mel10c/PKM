# Intro to Evolutionary Anthropology

## Reading

- <u>Anthropology</u> - the global and holistic study of human culture and biology
  - <u>Holistic</u> - considering all aspects of the research subject
- <u>Morphology</u>(形态学) - the study of the form and structure of organism
- <u>Ecology</u> - the study of interrelationships of organisms and their environemnt

### Studies of anthropology

> **<u>Evolutionary Anthology</u>** - a discipline within bio-ant, and application of evolutionary theories to study <u>morphology</u>(形态学), <u>ecology</u>(生态), and behaviour of human and non-human primates (**primatology**), extinct human and non-human primates (**paleoanthropology**), human diversity and variation, and the various evolutionary factors that influence human health (medical anthropology)

- <u>Primatology</u> - study of **non-human primate** species
- <u>Paleoanthropology</u>(古生物学) - study of biological evolution of **humans and non-human primates**
  - Multidisciplinary study of *biological evolution* of primates
  - Changes in human cultural activities 
  - *Human variation* - anthropologist study human variation to determine spatial and temporal variations in human features
- <u>Medical Anthropology</u> - the study of how social, environment, and biological factors **influence health and illness**
  - *Biological Anthropology* - the study of human and non-human primates in their biological and demographic dimensions
- <u>Forensic Anthropology</u> - focuses on the **skeletal remains** of humans. Seek to determine the age, sex, stature, ancestry, and any trauma or disease of the deceased.

#### Conducting Research

| <u>inference</u>   | a process of reasoning in which a conclusion is derived from one or more facts |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| <u>Falsifiable</u> | study design that enables the researcher to make observations that disprove a hypothesis |

- Research methods: <u>descriptive</u> (collect data about the study subject), <u>casual</u> (investigate cause and effect relationships), and <u>applied</u> (determines the means by which a specific recognized need can be met)

### Development of Evolutionary Concepts

| <u>**Paleontology**</u>      | the study of fossilized life forms                           |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| <u>classify</u>              | scientific methods of placing organisms in system based on order by classes & categories |
| <u>Taxonomy</u>              | theory and practice of describing, naming, and classifying extant and extinct organisms |
| <u>Binomial nomenclature</u> | the scientific methods for assigning names to species and genera |
| <u>**Genus**</u>             | (pl. genera) a taxonomic group of species exhibiting similar characteristics |
| <u>Biogeography</u>          | the scientific study of the geographic distributions of organism |
| <u>Comparative anatomy</u>   | the study of anatomical features of animals of different species (Similarities and differences between anatomies of different species) |
| <u>Fixity of spices</u>      | a theory that derives form Biblical creation, in which each living thing has always existed and will always exist by God;s acts of creation |
| <u>Catastrophism</u>         | the idea that catastrophic events altered geological features and caused that extinction of plants and animals |
| <u>Uniformitarianism</u>     | a theory that natural processes, such as erosion, operating in the past are the same as those that operate in the present |
| <u>Stratigraphy</u>          | the study of rock layers (strata) and the relationships among them |
| <u>Glaciology</u>            | the study of glaciers and other natural phenomena involving ice |

- ***Carolus Linnaeus*** - first comprehensive classification system for living thing
  - Each living thing named separate species (<u>Binomial Nomenclature</u>)
  - First letter of genus if capitalized, species destinations always lower case (*Homo sapiens*)
- ***Jean-Bapitiste Lamarck*** - developed Inheritance of Acquired Characteristics
  - <u>Acquired traits</u> - developed through use of disuse, passed on
  - First to formulate method for origination of new species through use or disuse of certain characters of organism

### **Charles Darwin** and Theory of Natural Selection

> Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace co-formulated the theory of natural selection. However, Darwin was unable to determine correctly how organismal traits passed from one generation to the next.
- <u>Botany</u> - the scientific study of plants
- He reasoned that nature selects for or against individuals in the natural world - favourable variations or traits of individuals of a species should enable some to better compete in nature
  - If variety proves *advantage* to certain individuals, then they may *produce* more offspring
- By **selection** - he meant that the environment chooses certain physical aspects of an organism, so that some individuals are more likely to survive than others. **[theory of natural selection]**
- The Tree of life - all extant and extent species share a common ancestry. The process of species for nation as a slow, gradual accumulation of slight variations in traits of individuals
- Societies change, they do no experience biological evolution
- Three Postulates of Darwinian Evolution 
    - <u>Struggle for existence</u> - ability of population to expand is infinite, but environment finite
    - <u>Variation in fitness</u> - Organisms vary, some individuals prossess traits enabling them to survive & reproduce more successfully than others in same environment
    - <u>Inheritance of variation</u> - advantageous traits inherited by offspring become more common in succeeding generations. Traits that confer advantages in survial and reproduction retained in population; disadvantageous traits disappear
- <u>Social Darwinisms</u> - the misguided application of the concepts of natural selection and biological evolution to the historical development of human societies, placing special emphasis on the idea of "survival of the fittest"
- <u>Creationism</u> - the largely Christian belief that all life was created by a supernatural deity (typically God), the existence of which is presupposed
- <u>Intelligent design</u> - the largely Christian belief that living things occur because of intelligent cause, not as a result of undirected process, such as evolution and natural selection
- <u>Theology</u> - the study of religion from a religious perspective 
- <u>Agnostic</u> - a person holding the belief that God is unknown and unknowable
- **Conclusion: No fixity of species and notion on short, catastrophic geological history for earth must be incorrect (hated slavery)**

### Gregor Mentel - father of genetics

> Gregor Mendel's studies of trait inheritance in pea plants revealed the mechanisms of heredity. Although contemporary scientists ignored Mendel's work, modern scientists credit Mendel as a founder of the science of genetics. 
- Genes -- basic, functional units of heredity
- <u>Phenotypes</u> - observable traits of an organism vs. <u>Genotype</u> - non-observable traits
- Allele - one of several forms of the same gene
- <u>Homozygous</u> - an individual has 2 of the same allele at a gene 
- <u>Heterozygous</u> - an individual has 2 different alleles at a gene
- <u>Dominant</u> allele - expressed alley in the phenotype
- <u>Recessive</u> allele - expressed only in the homozygous condition (both recessive)

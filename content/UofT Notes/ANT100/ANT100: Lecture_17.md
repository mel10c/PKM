# Primates

`February 4`

- ##### ==Key features of primates==

  - **Grasping hands and feet**
  - **Collarbone** (clavicle)
  - Radius and **ulna**

  - **Forward facing eyes** and stereoscopic vision
  - **Body size**: double the size -> 8x heavier
    - Smaller animals have greater heat loss than larger animals

- ##### Primate Activity Patterns

  - <u>Nocturnal</u>: active at night
  - <u>Diurnal</u>: active during the day
  - <u>Crepuscular</u>: active at dawn and dusk
  - <u>Cathemeral</u>: active any time of day or night

- ##### Primate Diet

  - Variety of **fruits**, **insects**, **flowers**, and **leaves** [eat only leaves require special gut adaptations]
  - **Larger primates typically eat more leaves** while smaller primates eat more insects

- ##### Primate Habitats

  - Tropical **rainforests**, dry forests, deserts, and savannas; primary vs. secondary forests; ecological Niche; forest microhabitats: emergent layer, canopy, understory

- ##### Primate Evolutionary Ecology

  - *Bottom-up processes* - plants altering their form to help/deter a primate
  - *Top-down processes* - pushed by predators
  - *Other processes*- seed dispersal and pollination; predation pressures on primates; plant defensive adaptations: physical/chemical (like caffeine or giant hogweed, opium in poppies, cocaine in the coca plant)

- ##### Primate Ranging Patterns

  - <u>Daily path length</u> - distance travelled in a day
  - <u>Daily range</u> - area the animal ventured into during a day
  - <u>Home range</u> - all the day ranges over the year; core area; territory

- ##### Primate Conservation:

  - Habitat disturbance: logging, agriculture; forest fragmentation
  - Hunting pressures [**subsistence** (sustainable) vs **economic** (unsustainable)]

  > Ex. Behaviour and Anthropology: must find solution by working together with locals

### Primate Sociality

- **==Complex social lives==**, including: deception; female mate choice (quite subtle); homosexuality (observed in hundreds of species); kin recognition; warfare; friendship

- **Primate Social Grooming:** about hygiene(卫生), but also forming and reconciling social bonds

- **Primate Dominance Hierarchies:** social order sustained by: aggression; affiliation; other behaviour patterns

- ##### ==Primate Social Organization==

  - Residence group composition
  - Mating systems: who mates with whom
  - Foraging coherence: who eats with whom

- ##### Philopatry type

  - Female philopatry - males leave at sexual maturity
  - Male philopatry - females leave at sexual maturity

- ==*Advantages of groups*==: improved **predator protection**; improved **access to food**; resource **defense**; increased access to potential mates

- ==*Disadvantages of groups*==: increased predator encounters; more mouths to feed; increased travel/foraging costs; disease transmission

  - <u>Disease Transmission</u>: gorillas and chimpanzees afflicted by same diseases as humans, like Ebola or COVID-19

## Suborder: Strepsirhines

> A suborder of primates that includes the lemuriform primates, which consist of the lemurs of Madagascar, galagos ("bushbabies") and pottos from Africa, and the lorises from India and southeast Asia.

### Characteristics

- Dental <u>toothcomb</u> (牙梳) - comprising a group of front teeth arranged in a manner that facilitates grooming

- Moist <u>rhinarium</u>(鼻) - furless skin surface surrounding the external openings of the nostrils

- <u>Tapetum lucidum</u> - a layer of tissue in the eye of many vertebrates

- <u>Postorbital barea</u> - a bony arched structure that connects the frontal bone of the skull to the zygomatic arch, which runs laterally around the eye socket.
- Unfused <u>mandibular</u>(下颌骨) and <u>frontal symphases</u> - line of junction where the two lateral halves of the mandible typically fuse at an early period of life

### Two Superfamilies

- <u>Lemuroidea</u> - lived on Madagascar and Comoro Islands; arboreal quadrupeds and leapers; some are partially terrestrial; many small-bodied species are nocturnal; female dominance; varied diet
  - Lemurs only exist in Madagascar (马达加斯加特有的狐猴)

- <u>Lorisoidea</u> -  found throughout sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia; lorises and galagos; arboreal quadrupeds; nocturnal, varied diet

## Suborder: Haplorhine

> The "dry-nosed" primates, is a suborder of primates containing the tarsiers and the simians (Simiiformes or anthropoids), as sister of the Strepsirrhini ("moist-nosed")

### Characteristics

- Dry nose 
- Retinal <u>fovea</u> - responsible for sharp central vision (also called foveal vision)
- <u>Postorbital closure</u> - separating the orbit from the temporal region
- Fused mandibular and frontal symphases (compared to Tarsiers)

### Three infraorders: Tarsiiformes, Platyrrhini, and Catarrhini

#### Tarsiiformes

- One genus (*Tarsius*); found in Southeast Asia (e.g., Philippines); small body size (80-130g); relatively large eyes (larger than brain), with fused lower leg bones; entirely faunivorous

#### Platyrrhines (Neotropical Monkeys)

- Central and South America; body mass: 110g – 11.4kg; Cebidae, Atelidae, and Callitrichidae; prehensile tail in a few species; most are entirely arboreal

#### Catarrhini (Old World Monkeys and Apes)

- Africa, Asia, and Southeast Asia; body mass: 1kg – 75kg; Cercopithecidae, Hylobatidae, and Hominidae; variety of diets, social organizations, and adaptations

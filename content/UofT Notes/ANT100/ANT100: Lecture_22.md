# Archaeological methods and Humanity's African Origins

`March 11`

## **Archaeological Methods**

- The methods we use influence the kinds of data that we can collect; methods shaped by research question
- How methods influence interpretation
  - Ex: The Boardwalk site: using screens found evidence of fish bones at a coastal site, which was previously believed to not have fish bones when excavated without screens
- **<u>Interpretation</u>** - how we **interpret the past determined by evidence**, but also our theoretical perspective; our idea, and research questions

### Archeological Evidence

- **==Artifacts; sites; features; ecofacts==** (plant remains/animal remains); stratigraphy(地层学); dates; matrix (the sediment making up the site); chemical Signature (example of residue of plant remains)

- <u>Archaeological Site</u> - the **accumulation of artifacts or ecofacts** representing a place where people carried out certain activities with features (which can be traced)

  - Can be thought of as a concentration of human activity; 

- <u>Fieldwork</u> - the act of finding archaeological sites

  - *Survey*: the search for archaeological sites (Aerial/ground); 
  - *Testing and excavation* of known or suspected archaeological sites
  - Fieldwork is undertaken: because of development; rescue excavation; cultural resource management (CRM); as a part of a research project

- <u>Archaeological Survey</u> - a systematic investigation of a specified area for archaeological remains; start with background research; historical documents; pre-existing archaeological sites; maps and aerial photographs; histories: Oral and Written; folklore, talking with locals

  > ##### Ex of *Oral Histories*:
  >
  > Erebus and Terror: Franklin’s Ships; 1845 search for the Northwest Passage; Inuit oral histories of ships trapped in ice, starvation, and locations of graves

### <u>Mapping</u> 

- For example, settlements may be found near bodies of water such as lakes/rivers

#### <u>Aerial Photography</u>(航空摄影)

- Taking of **photographs** of the ground from an elevated/birds eye position
- Record crop marks, observe that crops grow differently above soils with cultural features than those without cultural feature. Buried stone features lead to poorer crop growth directly above the stone

> ##### Ex1: Roman Harbour town of Altinum
>
> View full extent of or see how features are related; wider view of landscape; historical aerial photographs let you see landscape prior to recent development (example: 1930s photo of Poverty Point, Louisiana; 3600 – 3200 years old)
>
> ##### EX2: Amazon
>
> Recent research triggered by aerial photography (and deforestation); shows densely populated settlements, earthworks, and terraforming (about 1000 years old); evidence for farming & orchards

#### <u>LIDAR:</u> **Light Detection and Ranging**

- Great in **heavily forested environments**, plane flies over area, sends laser signals, which then bounce back to the plane if they hit something, and then recorded

- Records everything from top of the trees to the forest floor, remove forest signals to get map of ground level

  > Ex: Caracol (Mayan city-state) (quite remote site, discovered by a logger seeking mahogany); AD 550 to 900; over 4 billion measurements in 4 days; showed full extent of city and city viewed in 3D

#### Satellite Images

- Satellite images pick up on distinctive soil signatures

- Formed as people walked from settlements to fields/pastures over centuries

  > Ex. “hollow ways” or trackways in Syria (over 14000 settlements discovered using this method)

#### Ground Reconnaissance(侦查)

- “Ground truthing”; **pedestrian survey**; field walking; **isolated artifacts on the ground surface**; changes in soil/vegetation

  > Ex.  Prince Rupert Harbour in B.C., with lack of trees implying an ancient village); tree throws; exposed erosional face

#### Geophysics(地质物理学) in Archaeology

- The science of the physical properties of the Earth and its surroundings. Helps identify subsurface features prior to excavation; radar waves sent into ground and bounce back off of buried objects

  > Ex: Ground Penetrating Radar (Prof. Patton’s example of searching for old graveyard of escaped US slaves in southwestern Ontario)
  >
  > Ex: Ness of Brodgar: first identified using Ground Penetrating Radar; predates Stonehenge (on the Orkney Islands in northern Scotland)

- Excavation: 

  - **Vertical:** test pits or trenches that reveal stratification (or stratigraphy)
  - **Horizontal:** area excavations. Good for seeing arrangement of features

### Site Grid

- Facilitates documentation of provenience and mapping; **breaks site up into small units** (1x1m, 2x2m, etc.); site datum
- <u>Provenience</u>: place of origin; location, association, and context; X, Y, Z coordinates; stratigraphic deposit; found in association with what other objects?
- <u>Context</u>: without attention to context, archaeology is antiquarianism; how different is this from looting?
- **<u>Artifacts</u>**: objects created or modified by human action; technology, economy, exchange, ideology
- <u>**Ecofacts**</u>: **plant remains:** micro and macro; seeds, charcoal, starch grains; paleoethnobotanical analysis; **animal bones**; **shells**; faunal analysis or zooarchaeological analysis; questions pertaining to: economy, trade, domestication, social relations, ideology
- <u>Features</u>: an immovable structure or layer, pit, or post in the ground having archaeological significance; can be traces
- <u>Stratigraphy</u>: the layers of natural and human-generated **deposits** that reveal how sites formed and how materials accumulated; essential for understanding change through time; stratigraphic sequence shows **chronological arrangement of deposits**; a relative chronology
- <u>Relative Dating</u>: a technique used to **estimate the age of archaeological materials**, based on the **association** with materials of a known age or simply in relation to other materials; something is older or younger
- <u>Absolute Dating</u>: a method of assigning archaeological dates in calendar years; **often still an estimate**; most rely on **==radioactive decay in certain elements==**; radiocarbon dating (C14); radiopotassium (or potassium-argon) dating; dendrochronology
- <u>Radiocarbon Dating</u>: good for **wood, shell, animal bones**, antler; C14 unstable carbon isotope; half-life of 5730 years; plants absorb CO2; animals eat plants; when plants or animals die, intake of carbon stops; C14 begins to decay; 
  - <u>Calibration</u>: C14 dates must be **calibrated** to account for changes in the amount of C14 in atmosphere through time; 
    - Calibrated dates: C14 dates that have been “corrected” to calendar years
- <u>Radiopotassium Dating</u>: also called potassium-argon; measures ratio of radioactive potassium-40 to argon-40 in rocks and minerals (both radioactive)
- **The context of strata, artifacts, features, etc. is critical to understanding the past**

## Time in Long History (Prehistory):

- [Miocene (23.0 – 5.3 MYA)](##Miocene-(23.0-–-5.3 MYA)) - existence of earliest bipedal ancestors; 
- [Pliocene (5.3-2.6 MYA)](##Pliocene-(5.3-–-1.8 MYA)); Laetoli **footprints**; first s**tone tools**; start of the Paleolithic (old stone age); Pleistocene (2.6 MYA – 11.7 KYA); ice age; hominin ancestors first leave Africa

### [Homun Recent Time](##==Hominins==)

- Earliest controlled use of fire 1 MYA; Wonderwork Cave, South Africa
- Flaked Stone Fundamentals: <u>Flaked Stone</u> -  also called “lithics” (stone)
  - The material culture of the Paleolithic (Pliocene – Pleistocene)
- <u>Flintknapping</u>: the process of making chipped stone artifacts using a hard (hammerstone) or soft hammer (antler billet); percussion flaking; pressure flaking
- <u>Retouch</u>; the shaping or sharpening of stone artifacts through percussion or pressure flaking
- <u>Flintknapping Produces</u>: **cores and flakes**: attributes to know: **flake**: Platform, bulb of percussion; **core**: flake scar; **debitage** (the stuff that doesn’t get used)

#### **==<u>Oldowan</u>==**: (**Lower Paleolithic**)

- First identified and named for Olduvai Gorge; associated with [*H. habilis*](###*==Homo Habilis==*-[Tanzania,-Kenya,-and-Ethiopia-(2.3-1.6-MYA)])
- Start to find them in contexts dated 2.6 MYA
- **Earliest stone tools**; direct percussion method; flakes (cutting); cores, called chopper (marrow extraction, woodworking)
- Remarkably uniform across space and time (mostly found in East Africa)
- Probably used for hunting and scavenging; long-term use of specific tools


> ##### Understanding purpose of stone tools:
>
> - <u>Context</u>: found in **association with animal bones with cut marks** (butchery); other marks could signal hunting over scavenging; microscopic wear; experimental archaeology
> - *What earliest tools reveal about older hominins:* 
>   - **Problem solving**; manual dexterity(灵巧), Created a technology that becomes critical for adaptation; **abstract** idea of tool, **knowledge** of steps to make it; **learning** (social behaviours and communication); **social engagement** of multiple individuals

#### Acheulean: 

- Lithic industry associated with [*H. erectus*](###*==Homo Erectus==*-[Asia-and-Southeast-Asia-1.8 MYA-–-27-KYA])
- **Handaxe**; symmetrical and bifacially worked; 1.8 MYA – 200 KYA
- **Multi-purpose tool**; cutting, sawing, digging, bashing, boring; St. Acheul gravel pits, France; 1859 (tools at St. Acheul dated 500 – 300 KYA)

> ##### Cites related to this
>
> - *Zhoukoudian*: Davidson Black, 1927; *Sinanthropus pekinensis*; further excavations revealed remains of multiple individuals dating 700 – 200 KYA; **no handaxes**
> - *Boxgrove*: in the UK; attributed to *H. heidelbergensis*; believed to be first hominin in Europe; over 250 handaxes found; some appear to not have been used at all

#### Hunting.  400KYA, 500KYA

- **Cooperation** is a huge element of human evolution; may have been needles that serve as evidence of tailoring, for hominins living in colder climates

  > *Schöningen*, Germany -> 400 KYA; *Boxgrove*, England -> 500 KYA; serves as a reminder that 

#### Fire: Wonderwork Cave, 1 MYA

- Used to scares away animals; extends the socializing and working hours; it cooks food; key to life in cooler climates
- For [Gosden](##**==Chris Gosden==**'s-*Prehistory:-A-Very-Short-Introduction*), big changes occur ca. 800 KYA

# Europe, Asia, Africa Palaeolithic and Neolithic

`March 18`

## Middle Paleolithic: 200KYA – 40KYA

- *H. neanderthalensis* (Europe and Near East); *H. denisova* (Asia); *H. floresiensis* (Asia); **==*H. sapiens*==** (start in Africa, but spread throughout the world)
- For *H. sapiens*: overall, long distance of material suggests interconnectedness of people; shift towards blades and composite tools

#### Mousterian:

- Flakes made using **Levallois** technique; flakes retouched into many tool types: sidescrapers, points, denticulates; **associated with *Neanderthals***
  - <u>Levallois Technique</u>: **prepared** core; skill and time needed; produces several flakes

## Upper Paleolithic: 50-40KYA until approx. 10KYA:

- <u>Blades</u>: an elongated flake; length 2x its width; elaborate core preparation; mass production of blanks which can be retouched into different tools
- Increase in efficiency and effectiveness of use of raw material over time: 
  - `Oldowan -> Acheulean -> Mousterian -> Upper Paleolithic`
  - Up to 9m of cutting edge from 0.5kg of flint in Upper Paleolithic

#### Upper Paleolithic objects

- Deep attachment to objects (heirlooms(传家宝))

  > “artifacts take on a significance beyond the here and now” – Gosden

  - **Social connections over space and time** (materials and objects distributed over a wider area); composite tools, made from multiple materials

### Upper Paleolithic in Europe: 40KYA – 10KYA

- Numerous examples of rock art, particularly cave art

- Earliest evidence for art 77KYA in Southern Africa

- <u>Portable Art</u>: carved bone, antler, ivory; start to appear ca. 40KYA; Venus figurines (25KYA); more often found at **larger settlements representing aggregations of hunter-gatherers**

  > *Hohlenstein*, Germany: half-lion-half-man figure; 40 000 years old (made of mammoth ivory); **animism**: attributing a soul to things that we might think of as not having a soul

### Upper Paleolithic Settlement

- *Dolni Vestonice; Czech Republic*, 25KYA
- **Mammoth hunting**; bones used for fuel, architecture, tools, ornaments; settlement took place over several seasons
- The Near East: *Ohallo II*; semi-sedentary hunter-gatherers; 20KYA (Paleolithic)
- The Near East: Natufian: ca. 15 – 11KYA; wild grasses, nut trees, gazelles, goats; like Ohallo II, semi-sedentary hunter-gatherers
- <u>Natufian Settlement</u>: processing grains for storage (without pottery); sedentism; more of a stone element (stone foundations) [支持久坐或半固定的人口]

#### Roasting culture vs boiling culture peoples

- Natufians and Near East farmers are roasting culture
  - Natufian Example: *Abu Hereyra*: 13.5KYA; good gazelle-hunting location; seasonal use of wild plants and animals; semi-sedentary to year-round occupation; storage pits = “delayed return”; sub-floor burial of the dead
    - Abu Hureyra as a farming settlement: re-occupied PPNB (pre-pottery Neolithic B) (10.5 – 8.7KYA); 5000-6000 people
- Göbekli Tepe*: Holocene: current geological epoch; starts ca. 11.7KYA; not the only example of stone architecture from that time period in the Near East; Göbekli Tepe can be interpreted as **“Houses”** (structures associated with lineages)

#### How do we know a plant is domesticated? 

- Domesticated plants have: **tough rachis; larger seeds; different genetic signature**

### Farming in Europe: 

- Southeast Europe (8500 years ago); Central and Western Europe (7500 years ago); Britain and North Europe (6000 years ago); 
  - DNA evidence suggests migration of people from Middle East; migrants brought grains, animals
- *Linear Band Keramik (LBK)* 7200 – 6500 years ago: long, rectangular houses; Middle Danube area, central Europe
- *Talheim* (6900 years ago): massacre site; men, women, and children; farmer-farmer violence, not farmer vs hunter-gatherer, as previously believed
- *Talianky*: Cucuteni-Trypillia culture; 5850 – 5700 years old (Neolithic); Ukraine (Eurasian Steppe); huge farming town, population around 10 000; 200 such settlements in and around the Ukraine; were able to make two-story houses that were plastered on the inside, and painted; seemed to have been burned to the ground by the inhabitants every 60-80 years

### Neolithic in Northern and Western Europe: 6000 – 5000 years ago;

- Earthen Long Barrows; example: West Kennet Long Barrow, on Salisbury Plain
- Early Neolithic (Orkney): Maeshowe (4800 years old); chambered tomb
- Ring of Brodgar: 5200 years ago: near Maeshowe; one of the **earliest stone circles in the UK**
- **<u>Ness of Brodgar</u>**: predates Stonehenge; shows that places that seem isolated today (like the Orkneys) were very important 5000 years ago; at least 10 massive stone structures; places of residence and ritualroduced more art than any other Neolithic site in the UK
- <u>Skara Brae</u>: farming village composed of semi-subterranean houses, with tunnels between houses; fisher-farmers
- <u>Grooved Ware</u>: pottery made in Orkneys; both for everyday and ritual use; mostly used to serve food and drink; this style also found on Salisbury Plain; similar motifs to those found on passage graves in Ireland
- Salisbury Plain (Stonehenge): built between 5000 – 3500 years ago; burial ground (mostly cremations), not everyone could be buried there though

### Africa

- Northeast Africa: tef, millet, coffee
- Central Africa: millet, sorghum (ca. 8000 years ago)
- West Africa: rice

#### Hunter-Gatherers in North Africa:

- Sahara was much wetter 14KYA than it is today (late Pleistocene); similar lifestyle to Natufians; evidence of pottery

#### Hunter-Gatherers in the Sahara:

> Ex. Gobero, Niger; large cemetery (over 200 burials); 9700 – 8200 years ago

- <u>Pastoralism</u>: cattle domestication 9KYA in places; cattle burials (“cattle cult”) 7th millennium

### Acorns, Rice Agriculture, and pottery in **China**

- First grinding stones 28KYA; first pottery: 20KYA; first wild rice used as temper in pottery: ca. 10KYA; Shangstan: 11.4 – 8.6KYA (evidence for domesticated rice)
- <u>Metallurgy</u>: used after about 5000 years ago; Sintashta culture (Eurasian Steppe); bronze-making; fortified settlements and burial tumuli; chariots, horses, mobility (sometimes lavishly furnished); metallurgy often viewed in connection with social inequality and urban living

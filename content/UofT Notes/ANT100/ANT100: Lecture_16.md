# Principles of Evolution

`January 28`

## Genetics Terms

- <u>Somatic cells</u> - most cells in body, except sex cells
- <u>Gametes</u> - sex cells
- <u>Cytoplasm</u> - mix of membranes, molecules, and organelles
- <u>Nucleus</u> - contains hereditary material, or chromosomes
- **<u>Chromosomes</u>** - Structures in nucleus containing genes that transmit traits through generations 
  - *(humans have 23 pairs, other animals have more)*

### Critical Acids (DNA & RNA) Structure

- <u>Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA)</u> -  nucleic acid used to **store genetic information**
  - Four bases: Adenine (A), Guanine (G), Cytosine (C), and Thymine (T) 
  - T bonds with A, G bonds with C
- <u>Ribonucleic Acid Molecules (RNA)</u>
  1. Dictate synthesis of proteins that perform a wide variety of functions in body
  2. **Regulate expression** of other genes
  3. Work with structures in cell (ribosomes) that are critical for **manufacture of proteins**
  4. **Transport** amino acids to ribosomes for the creation of proteins
- <u>Proteins</u>: linear sequence of **amino acids** (*building blocks of cells*)
  - Function determined by DNA; for example, <u>**enzymes**</u> (catalysis of biochemical reactions) or <u>hemoglobin</u> (transports oxygen in the blood)
  - Many animals (like dogs) cannot process caffeine or chocolate, as they lack the necessary *enzymes*
- <u>Transcription</u> -  synthesis of single strand of **mRNA (messenger RNA)**; results in genetic information transferred from DNA to RNA, then carried to cytoplasm

- <u>Codons</u> -  sequence of 3 nucleotides (basic structure unit for DNA/RNA) containing genetic info
- 4 **<u>nucleotides</u>** of RNA are: adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and **==uracil (U)==** [which replaces thymine (T) in DNA template (uracil replaces thymine for increased RNA stability and replication efficiency)]
- <u>Translation</u> -  **tRNA (transfer RNA)** (information adapter molecule) decodes information in mRNA; amino acid attaches to acceptor stem, then anticodon reads information via base pairing
- `DNA -> (Transcription) -> RNA -> (Translation) -> Protein`

## Genetics and Heredity

- <u>Gene</u> - chemical unit of heredity

- <u>Alleles</u> - one member of a pair of genes

- ==**<u>Phenotype</u>**== - **observable** physical appearance of organism

- <u>**Genotype**</u> - total complement of inherited traits or genes

- **==<u>Homozygous</u>==** - possessing **two identical genes** or alleles in corresponding locations on a pair of chromosomes. For example, YY or yy

- **==<u>Heterozygous</u>== ** - possessing **different genes** or alleles in corresponding locations on a pair of chromosomes. For example: Yy

- **<u>Dominant alleles</u>** - allele of gene pair that is **always phenotypically expressed** in heterozygous form [For example: Y always expressed phenotypically when paired with y (Yy)]

- **<u>Recessive alleles</u>** - allele **phenotypically suppressed** in heterozygous form and *expressed only in homozygous form*. [For example: y only expressed phenotypically when paired with y (yy)]

  > In Mendel’s experiment (3 yellow: 1 green phenotypically) (1 YY: 2 Yy: 1 yy genotypically)

- <u>Mutation</u> -  randomly occurring; **result of error/change in nucleotide sequence**; somatic vs germ cell mutations

  - Can be neutral, harmful, or (very rarely) beneficial; ultimate source of new genetic materials
  - *4 factors:* ① **copying errors** in cell division, ② **exposure to radiation** (especially sunlight), ③ **exposure to mutagens**, or ④ **exposure to viruses**

- <u>Genetic Drift</u> - random changes in gene pool over time

- *3 important outcomes:* ① **reduces within-population genetic variation**, ② more likely to effect small populations, ③ **increase between-population genetic variation**

- <u>Gene Flow</u> - movement of genes between populations

- *2 important outcomes:* ① initially, **increases** within-population genetic variation, ② eventually, **reduces between-population genetic variation**

- **<u>Natural Selection</u>** - any consistent difference in fitness among **phenotypically different** biological entities; deterministic process; acts only on existing variation [**Deterministic for evolution**]

  - ==**Biological evolution can occur without natural selection, and vice versa**==

### Adaptation: process and feature

- *Process*: **change** in organism enabling it to better reproduce and survive in its environment
- *Feature*: **characteristic** that performs a function of utility to the organism possessing it
- <u>Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR)</u> - serious threat to global public health; 480 000 people develop drug-resistant TB each year
- <u>Macroevolution</u> - large-scale changes at or above the species level; extends over geological era

### Cladistics: a biological ==taxonomy sytem==

- Based on *qualitative analysis* of comparative data that is used to reconstruct (assumed) phylogenetic relationships and evolutionary history of groups of organisms

- <u>Clade</u> - a group of organisms that contains an **ancestral <u>taxon</u>** (group of one/more organism) and all of its **descendants**; can orient cladogram in any direction with no change

- <u>Tree topology</u> - the branching patterns of lines connecting nodes and organisms

  - Focus on internal branches; watch out for polytomies

- <u>Cladogram</u> - branching *diagram* used to illustrate phylogenetic relationships

  - May have any number of clades
  - Reading a Cladogram - Interested in tree topology; 

- ##### 3 Major Assumptions of cladistics

  - There are changes in characteristics within lineages **over time** (Some have not changed in many years, like Greenland sharks or coelacanths)
  - All organisms are descended from a **common ancestor**
  - When a lineage splits, it **divides into exactly two groups**

- ##### How to do Cladistics:

  1. Choose taxa whose evolutionary relationships interest you. These taxa must be <u>clades</u> (monophyletic group) if you hope to come up with plausible results
  2. Determine <u>characters</u> (features of organisms) and examine each taxon to determine character <u>states</u> (decide whether each taxon does or does not have each character)
  3. Determine polarity of characters (character state is original or derived in each taxon) using <u>out-group</u> (more distantly related group of organisms that serves as a reference group)
  4. Group taxa by <u>synapomorphies</u> (shared derived characteristics; **derived**) not <u>symplesiomorphies</u> (original, or “primitive”, characteristics; **ancestral**)

- ##### 3 Misconceptions About Cladograms

  1. Evolution produces patterns of relationships among organisms that are like a tree
  2. Although cladograms are often organized from top to bottom, **don’t assume the taxa on top are more advanced than those taxa on the bottom**
  3. Avoid reading across terminal nodes (tips), order of which has no meaning

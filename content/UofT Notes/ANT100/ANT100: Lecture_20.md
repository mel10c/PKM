# Forensic Anthropology & Archaeology

`March 4`

### Sexual Variation

- Just as morphological variation in humans, we have a fantastic **variety of gender** and sexual identities and biologies, respectively
- Biological **<u>sex</u>** is a function of chromosomes, gonads, hormones, and genitals
  - *Old days:* external male genitalia or female genitalia;
  - *Now:* XY (male) or XX (female); Trisomy (XXX, XXY, XYY); Pentasomy (including XXXX, XXYY, XXXXX, XXXXY and XYYYY)
  - *New days:* all kinds of external and internal parts
- Biological sex is **incredibly variable and complicated** in plants and animals; not just ours
  - <u>Gymnopthalmus</u>: Unisexual species: only “girls”, reproducing through parthenogenesis (non-sperm reproduction)
    - Seen in hundreds of insect and animal, but not in humans **until done so in a lab by accident**; 
  - <u>Sequential hermaphroditism</u> (顺序雌雄同体) - individual changes sex at some point in its life (male to female, female to male, female>hermaphrodite)
    - Develop in males first, and when they mature, some become females. If **dominant female** is removed from group, largest and **most dominant male becomes a female** (like clownfish)

## Medical Anthropology

- <u>Medical anthropology</u> - a subfield of anthropology that draws upon social, cultural, biological, and linguistic anthropology to better understand those factors which influence health and well being

  > (broadly defined): experience and distribution of illness; prevention and treatment of sickness; healing processes; social relations of therapy management; cultural importance and utilization of pluralistic medical systems

- Medical Anthropologists and Applied Anthropology are interested in 

  - Infectious disease; caused by microbial agent (common flu); co-evolution of humans & pathogens; death rates by infectious disease between developed countries (low) & developing countries (high)
  - **Pandemics**: COVID-19 (likely zoonotic transmission from bats to humans); likely first case in Hubei Province; at least 115 973 916 cases to date; chronic disease: non-reversible pathology (such as heart disease)

- ==<u>Antibiotics</u>== - antimicrobial drug used in treatment and prevention of bacterial infections

  - Antibiotics revolutionized medicine in 20th century, contributing to near eradication of some diseases (some STDs, tuberculosis, etc.)

  - **Antimicrobial resistance (AMR)** - threatens effective prevention and treatment of an ever-increasing range of infections caused by bacteria, parasites, viruses, and fungi

    > In 2016 an *E. coli* bacteria “superbug” was identified that is resistant to colistin, “last line of defense” antibiotic in humans

- ==<u>Vaccinations</u>== - **antigenic material** (a vaccine) to *stimulate an individual’s immune system* to develop adaptive immunity to a pathogen; ancient technique

  > 10th-17th century Chinese & Indian physicians powdered **smallpox** scabs to prevent infection: Of children infected, > 80% died from disease; 
  >
  > **Widespread immunity** due to vaccination and **herd immunity** is largely responsible for worldwide eradication(根除) of smallpox and restriction of diseases such as polio, measles, and tetanus;

  - **Anti-vaccination movement** - parents (who have been vaccinated) not vaccinating their children due to ignorance (**they have no experience with the pathogens)** but not lack of intelligence; many have university degrees and equivalent training

- **Nutrition and health** 

  - **Malnutrition crisis**: developing nations; protein malnutrition; micronutrient malnutrition; 
  - **Obesity crisis**: developed nations; complex causes

## Forensic Anthropology

> A special sub-field of **physical anthropology** (the study of human remains) that involves applying skeletal analysis and techniques in archaeology to solving *criminal cases.*

- <u>Forensic anthropology</u> - “applied” science; borrows methods and techniques developed from skeletal biology, osteology, and anatomy; and applies them to cases of forensic importance
  - Forensic means “legal”; (not like CSI TV shows)
  - **Methods and techniques to assess**: age, sex, stature, and trauma/pathology
  - Apply these methods to unknown modern human remains, with aim of establishing identity or manner of death, practicing forensic application of osteology
  - To understand different populations living all over world at different times throughout history

#### **Assessing age in skeletons**

- Younger individual is, more accurately their age can be determined (up to about 25 years)

  - Since process of ossification(骨化) proceeds more rapidly at earlier ages, and there are more developing bones to examine

  > For example: compare state of appearance, union, or epiphyseal union of bones of an individual’s skeleton to a table, chart, or graphic that tells ages associated with these events

#### Assessing sex in skeletons

- Pronounced difference in shape of pelvis(骨盆). Birth canal larger & rounder in females; males have narrower pelvis, with smaller and less rounded birth canal

#### Assessing stature(身高) in skeletons

- <u>Sexual dimorphism</u> - males and females differ in body size (females around 85-95% size of males);
  - Difference in size is seen in every bone of body, males continue growing longer than females do
  - By time people reach age 20, **females are ~ 2 years ahead of males in skeletal maturation**

#### Assessing pathology or trauma in skeletons

- <u>Lesion(损伤)</u> - pathologically(病理学上) produced feature of a bone; such as syphilis
- <u>Bone trauma</u> - hole, break, or other traumatic damage
- Overall nature of bone defect, timing of trauma relative to death, and nature of forces that operated on a bone causing certain trauma
  - <u>Pre-mortem</u> - defect occurred before death
  - <u>Peri-mortem</u> - defect occurred around time of death
  - <u>Post-mortem</u> - defect occurred significantly after death

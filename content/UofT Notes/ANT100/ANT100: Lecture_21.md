# ARCH Intro

### **==Chris Gosden==**’s *Prehistory: A Very Short Introduction*

- Rethink prehistory in a non-progressivist framework; the past is contested; examples from parts of the world you are unlikely to have heard about
- Implies people without writing are unchanging
- Written histories imply progress, All peoples have ways of recording their histories
- For Gosden, prehistory is long **==history (about process, not events)==**

## Agriculture

- Older ideas: cultural evolution: progressive, “onwards and upwards”

#### **==Gordon Childe==**: The Neolithic “revolution”;

- Neolithic = “New Stone Age”, changed every facet of human life. 
- Agriculture as a **Process**: a process between people and plants (or animals)

### **The Near East:** Ohallo II

- Semi-sedentary hunter-gatherers; 20 KYA (Paleolithic)

### **PPNB (Pre-pottery Neolithic B)** (ca. 9000 – 10 000 years ago)

- Large farming villages, example “Abu Hureyra” (5000 people)
- Acorns, Rice Agriculture, and pottery in China
  - First grinding stones 28 KYA
  - First pottery: 20 KYA
  - First wild rice used as temper in pottery ca. 10 KYA

## What is archaeology?

- <u>Archaeology</u> - “The study of the past, combining themes of time and change” OR “The study of the past through its material remains” (Johnson 2010:1)

  - Material remains = artifacts, features, food remains, houses, settlements, etc.
  - Change through time: **==culture change cannot be explained by natural selection alone==**
    - No one overarching theory of culture change exit in archaeology

- Archaeology is multidisciplinary

  - Anthropology: ethnographies, social theory; sciences: zoology, chemistry, physics, biology; history: Oral history, classics, archival materials, history; historical archaeology – archaeology in combination with written records (won’t discuss much in this course)

  > Ex: Newark, Ohio country club built on remains of giant earthwork structure, build by Indigenous peoples

## What is heritage

> Tangible and intangible

#### **Inherited property: Cultural Heritage**

- “The sites, movable and immovable **artifacts, practices, knowledge items, and other things that a group or society has identified as old, important**, and therefore worthy of conscious conservation measures, often at the hands of specialized institutions” -Christoph Bruman, 2015
- Cultural heritage: “**Reflects the human aspects of our communities that shape who we are** and how we interact with the world around us” -Joe Watkins, 2016

#### Heritage/Archaeology and Nationalism:

- Champlain Statue, Orillia, Ontario (features 2 Indigenous peoples looking up at a Jesuit priest) (statue has now been removed); (Finding the lost Franklin ships, *Erebus* and *Terror*) (Considered important for Canadians, to maintain claim on the Arctic)

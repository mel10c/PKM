# Intro to Evolutionary Anthropology

`January 14`

- <u>Evolutionary Anthropology:</u> Application of modern evolutionary theory to studies of morphology, ecology, and behaviour of human and non-human primates
- <u>Primatology</u>: Study of **non-human primates**
- <u>Paleoanthropology</u>: Study of **biological evolution** of humans and non-human **primates**, advent of and changes in human cultural activities, evolutionary  of behaviour in humans and non-human primates
  - *Evolution is not about making things better
- <u>Human Variation</u>: Spatial and temporal variations in human features (such as climatic/geographic variations)
- <u>Medical Anthropology:</u> How various factors influence health and illness of individuals at small and large levels
- <u>Forensic Anthropology</u>: Focus on human skeletal remains, seek to determine features of the deceased

## Scientific Method:

| S    | **S**tate the problem       |
| ---- | --------------------------- |
| G    | **G**ather information      |
| F    | **F**orm a hypothesis       |
| T    | **T**est the hypothesis     |
| R    | **R**ecord and analyze data |
| S    | **S**tate the conclusion    |
| R    | **R**epeat the work         |

- Multiple scientists do same work, to avoid bias

## Evolutionary Theory

> #### Problems that Limited Evolutionary Theory:
> 
> 1. Lack of knowledge of age of Earth
> 2. **Religious** concept of fixity of species
> 3. Lack of **scientific method**
> 4. Religious notion of separate creation for humans and animals 
> 
> - According to Bishop Usher, Earth was created on October 23, 4004 BC (2:30 pm)
> - Fixity of species: All species are unchanging and distinct, as created by God
> - Many ideas and concepts based on verbal accounts of travellers, which were often inaccurate
> - Belief that humans are divine, and above non-human animals

### Development of Evolution Theory

- **==Carolus Linneaus==** (1707-1778): Father of Taxonomy; **grouped species by genus**, based on physical resemblances; believed he was classifying God’s creations; *Scala Naturae*, leading up to humans on top; others continued his work after his death
  - *Binomial Nomenclature* (system): First letter of genus capitalized, species designation lowercase [ex. *Homo sapiens*]
- **Georges-Louis Leclerc** (1707-1788): Believed Earth was 75 000 years old; wrote book about it which was criticized by the church; founded biogeography (**different regions with similar climates have distinct plants and animals**)
- **Jean-Baptiste Lamarck** (1744-1829)
    - **Inheritance of Acquired Characteristics**: creatures have “vital traits” that help them adapt to environments, which are passed on to future generations; this theory does not support idea that giraffes willed their necks to grow longer
- **==Charles Darwin==** (1809-1882): 
    - First concluded that Earth must have an ancient history, no fixity of species (kept ideas private)
  - **Variation** leads to **advantages** for certain individuals, meaning **higher reproduction**, and said variation becomes the norm
- **Thomas Malthus** (1766-1834): *Essay on the Principle of Population* (1798): more organisms are born than can possibly survive; individuals **adapt** to environments, which leads to evolutionary shift over time (Darwin)

## Darwin’s Theory on Natural Selection:

> **All species (extant and extinct) share a common ancestor; species evolve by natural selection**

- **==Alfred Russell Wallace==** (1823-1913): Writes to Darwin, describing ideals similar to those Darwin has kept hidden for years, less evidence but similar core ideas; joint presentation of ideas proposed
- Darwin published *On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection or The Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life*
- The word “evolution” does **NOT** appear in the first edition of *Origins of Species*Darwin avoided implications of general progress or directionality; his later works apply evolution to humans

### Natural Selection

- A **process in nature resulting in survival** and perpetuation of only those forms of life having certain **favourable ==characteristics==** that enable them to **==adapt== best to their environment.**

#### Three postulates of Darwinian Evolution:

1. **Struggle for existence**: ability of population to expand is infinite, but their environment is finite
2. **Variation in fitness**: Organisms vary, some individuals possess traits enabling them to survive and reproduce more successfully than others in the same environment
3. **Inheritance of variation**: Advantageous traits inherited by offspring become more common in succeeding generations. Traits that confer advantages in survival and reproduction retained in population; *disadvantageous traits disappear*.

### **Sexual selection**

- Certain evolutionary traits can be explained by ==**intraspecific**== (within-species) ==**competition**== 
  - [Male birds are much more brightly coloured than females, to better attract a mate)
- Elaborate animal mating rituals, competition among males for female access
- ***Evolution does not always result in general increase of fitness***
  - Environment constantly changing (usually for the worse); Red Queen analogy (must keep running to survive); design limitations in biology

### “Survival of the Fittest”: 

- Coined by **Herbert Spencer,** NOT Darwin
- Proclaimed **wrongly** that *human struggles for existence leads to beneficiary evolution*; argued against policies that might interfere with this progress, like charity
- Major weakness of Darwinian Evolution: **No explanation on how characteristics inherited;** Darwin could never prove it

## Inheritance

- **==Gregor Mendel==** (1822-1884): Pea plant experiment; chose pea plants for several reasons: 
  - <u>Inbred</u>: true-breeding lines
  - <u>Hybrids</u>: quantify traits
  - <u>Observable traits</u>: flower colour, seed colour, etc.
  - Plants small: easy to grow in large numbers, short generation time for several crosses per growing season
  - Self-fertilizing: but can cross fertilize
- Mendel cross-pollinated green and yellow plants (all yellow seeds produced), then self-pollinated yellow plants, and found 3:1 ratio of yellow to green seeds (green seeds are dormant trait)\
- Concluded each plant carries 2 copies of “factor” which determines a trait; published findings gathered little interest for over 100 years
- No understanding of genetics at the time, Mendel could not explain his findings

> - Mendelian Traits in Humans: cleft chin (dominant), cheek dimples (dominant), free (dominant) or attached (recessive) earlobes, wet (dominant) or dry (recessive) earwax
> - Non-Mendelian Traits: eye colour, hair colour, Morton’s Toe, tongue rolling, wisdom, athletic ability

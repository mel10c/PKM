## Rise of the genus *homo*

> **Species in the genus:** *homo*: habilis; rudolfensis; erectus; ergaster; heidelbergensis; antecessor; neanderthalensis; floresiensis; sapiens (us)

- First evolved in Africa; most date 2.4-1.8 MYA; first fossil member is *Homo habilis* (handy man); named such due to possible stone tools discovered nearby; some suggest *H. habilis* is actually multiple species

### *==Homo Habilis==* [Tanzania, Kenya, and Ethiopia (2.3-1.6 MYA)]

![Homo Habilis](https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/008eGmZEly1gpm9zaglxzj307k055dfr.jpg)

- **Species designation** - brain size and association with stone tools
- Skeletal morphology **similar to contemporaneous australopithecines**
- May represent 2 or more different species (*H. rudolfensis* & *H. habilis*)

### *Homo rudolfensis*: Koobi Fora, Kenya

- Originally considered *H. habilis*
- Does *H. rudolfensis* or *H. habilis* first representative of our genus? Very **controversial** (since many specimens are highly fractured

### *==Homo Erectus==* [Asia and Southeast Asia 1.8 MYA – 27 KYA]

- First species in genus *homo* found **outside Africa**
- Brain and body size **changes** in lineage
- Controlled use of **fire** and hunting; early African specimens may be different species, *Homo ergaster*

### *Homo ergaster*: East and South Africa; 1.8 – 1.3 MYA

- Distinguished from *H. erectus* by **thinner skull-bones** & lack of an obvious **supraorbital foramen**(眶上孔)
- Debate on *H. ergaster* or *H. erectus* as direct ancestor of modern humans

### *Homo heidelbergensis*: Europe and Africa; 700 – 130 KYA

- Compared to *H. erectus*, *H. heidelbergensis* has **smaller dentition, larger brain size, and larger body size**

### *Homo antecessor*: Spain; 1.2 MYA – 800 KYA

- Controversy surrounding species designation; type specimen is juvenile
- 1st hominin in Europe?

### *==Homo neanderthalensis==*: Europe and Middle East (300 – 35 KYA)

- **Limb bones** heavily marked by **muscular attachments**
- Thick walls of cortical bone & large joints
- Neanderthals **==extremely muscular==**, highly active, & athletic by modern human standards; Neanderthals made stone tools, used fire, and were hunters
- Geneticists able to extract DNA from 3 Neanderthal specimens
  - Early studies: Genetics of Neanderthals vs modern humans point to a 706 KYA separation & considerable variation
  - Recent studies: Half of Neanderthal genome; demonstrated a range of genetic contribution to non-African modern humans of 1% to 4%, likely in Levant (Middle East); **VERY CONTROVERSIAL!**

### *Homo naledi*: discovered 2013 in South Africa; not dated as yet

- Body mass and stature **= small-bodied human populations**
- Endocranial(颅内膜) volume similar to Australopithecus; skull shape similar to early *Homo* species
- Skeleton combines primitive features in australopithecines with features known from hominids

### *Homo floresiensis*: Flores Island, Indonesia; 95 – 13 KYA

- Small body size (ca. 1.06 m); small brain size; primitive and derived features
- NOT aberrant individual; rather, unique species

### *==Homo sapiens==*: ca. 160 KYA in Africaca. 100 KYA in Middle East, and ca. 40 KYA in Europe

- Controlled **use of fire**; **hunting and gathering**; **cultural** remains
- Increasingly complex stone tools

## Human Origins

#### Hypothesis

- **Replacement Hypothesis:** one wave of human dispersal and replacement of other congenera(先天) out of Africa; modern humans are descendants of African *H. sapiens* 
  - *H. neanderthalensis* is evolutionary dead end
- **Multiregional Hypothesis:** no wave of *H. sapiens* replacements; *H. erectus* most recent common ancestor of modern humans
  - *H. neanderthalensis* contributed to gene pool of some modern human populations

#### Analysis of **multiple** human genes reveals patterns of recurrent gene flow

- *Denisova hominin* [Denisova Cave: In Russia]
  - Russian archaeologists found finger bone of juvenile hominin (X woman) & tooth from young male about 41 KYA; mtDNA (bone) and nuclear DNA (tooth analysis) indicated that: **Modern Humans, Neanderthals, and Denisova hominin last shared common ancestor around 390 KYA**
  - Denisovans actually a sister group to Neanderthals; Denisovans lived among and interbred with the ancestors of some modern humans in Southeast Asia
- **DNA Evidence of Admixture:** identified DNA inherited from multiple archaic hominin ancestors and applied it to 1523 geographically diverse individuals, including 35 new Island Melanesian genomes
  - Indicating ancestors of modern humans interbred with Neanderthals and Denisovans at least **four times** in course of prehistory;
  - Interbreeding may have given modern humans genes that **bolstered immunity to pathogens**

- **Direct Evidence of Admixture:** genome of Denisova 11; a bone fragment from 13-year-old girl from Denisova Cave, comes from an individual who had a **Neanderthal mother and a Denisovan father**
  - Likely migration of Neanderthals between eastern & western Eurasia occurred after 120 KYA

## Human variation (race)

- **<u>Race</u> (science)** - a *geographically circumscribed(外接的)* population or set of populations that differ from all other populations of a species
- <u>Race</u> (biology) - synonymous with subspecies (geographically isolated populations within species)

#### Racial Bundles

- *“White” bundle*: pale skin; straight or wavy hair; noses of narrow to medium width; medium to tall stature
- *“Black” bundle*: black or dark brown skin; wiry hair; thick noses and lips; medium stature

#### Skin Colour Adaptation

- Physical traits have broad distributions, rather than being clustered in a particular area
  - Dark brown skin is found in Sub-Saharan Africans as well as people from Southern Asia, Australia, New Guinea and on nearby islands of Melanesia, as well as in much of the Americas
  - Produced by **melanin in epidermis**
  - **==<u>Melanin</u>==** - primary determinant of human skin colour and also found in hair and other body parts; melanin provides ultraviolet radiation protection, nutrient protection, Vitamin D synthesis
- **“Racial” Abilities:** not an idea supported by anthropologists; lack of *scientific* support

> ##### Are there human races? 
>
> **==No==** biological or phylogenetic ways to define a human race; race concepts based on everything from skin colour through region(s) of origin to ethnicity; crude classification system typically involves self-identification based on up-bringing, culture, ethnicity etc.; morphological and genetic differences in human “races” much smaller than those needed to consider nonhuman animals subspecies; 
>
> **Conclusion: no human races

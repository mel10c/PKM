## Paleocene (65.5 – 55.8 MYA)

> Climate: hotter, more humid than modern-day

### Plesiadapaformes/Plesiadapids (Paleocene primate-like mammals)

- Size of shrew to small dog; likely solitary; nocturnal; quadrupedal; good sense of smell; diet of insects and seeds; was considered a primate because of teeth and limbs (adapted those for arboreal lifestyle)

- Argument (primate or not)
  - They are **not primates**: ① No postorbital bar; ② Claws instead of nails; ③ Eyes placed on side of head; ④ Enlarged incisors Recently
  - They **ARE primates**: origin of primates estimated 85 MYA, but no evidence past 65 MYA

## Eocene (55.8 – 33.9 MYA)

> Climate: began warm, but began to drop around 50 MYA

- Brain size: Eocene primates had relatively **small brain size**, which implies neither arboreality nor frugivory was responsible for large brain size of modern primates

### Adapidae

- 100 – 6900 grams; diurnal and nocturnal; mainly arboreal quadrupeds; smaller ones ate mainly fruit and insects; larger ones ate more fruit and leaves

### Omomyidae

- 45 – 2500 grams; diurnal and nocturnal; likely specialized leapers; teeth mainly adapted for eating insects and soft fruit, though some ate leaves

## Oligocene (33.9 – 23.0 MYA)

> Climate: Temperature initially static, increased at the end; increase in forests

### Oligocene primates

- 3 *[Haplorhine](##Suborder:-Haplorhine)* features: fused **frontal bone**; full postorbital closure; fused mandibular symphasis
- 3 Taxonomic groups: <u>Parapithecidae</u>; <u>Propliopithecidae</u>; [Platyrrhini](####Platyrrhines-(Neotropical-Monkeys))

### South American primates

- In late Oligocene, primates begin to **appear** in fossil record of **South America**; origins unclear, but may have **“rafted” over from Africa around 35 MYA**

## Miocene (23.0 – 5.3 MYA)

> Climate: temperatures initially warm, before gradually decreasing

- First primate evolved in this period in Africa

### Monkeys & apes (e.g., *Proconsul*), 23.0-16.0 MYA, Africa

- <img src="https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/008eGmZEly1gpm8q4bvynj306404sq2w.jpg" alt="Proconsul" style="zoom:50%;" /> In Early Miocene (23.0-16.0 MYA), confined to Africa

### Ape-like catarrhines (e.g., *Dryopithecus*), 16.0-11.6 MYA, Europe and Asia

- <img src="https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/008eGmZEly1gpm8qfclpaj30lc0cvgmy.jpg" alt="Dryopithecus" style="zoom:25%;" /> In Mid-Miocene (16.0-11.6 MYA), widespread and diverse in Europe and Asia

### Apes (e.g., *Sivapithecus*), 11.6-5.3 MYA

- <img src="https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/008eGmZEly1gpm8qn12gxj306o05bjrp.jpg" alt="Sivapithecus" style="zoom:50%;" /> In Late Miocene (11.6-5.3 MYA)

- Apes became rarer as woodlands & forests replaced by drier and more open habitats

## Pliocene (5.3 – 1.8 MYA)

> Climate: fluctuations in global temperature

### Fossil *Cercopithecinae* and fossil *Colobinae*

- <img src="https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/008eGmZEly1gpm8tpa806j31400u00zf.jpg" alt="Cercopithecinae" style="zoom:10%;" /> <img src="https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/008eGmZEly1gpm8twtzz8j30m80ciq4j.jpg" alt="colobinae" style="zoom:25%;" /> (phylogenetic relationships unresolved)

#### Transitional Forms (Apes: Humans);

1. Modifications of postcranial skeleton for **==bipedal locomotion==**
2. Shape and size of <u>**canines**</u>(犬齿), especially in males, changes so they aren’t pointy or blade-like. **Reduction** in level of sexual dimorphism in canine size
3. **==Expansion of brain==**

## ==Hominins==

- **Modern humans, chimpanzees, and fossil species more closely related to each other than to any other living species**
- First hominin fossils was found in **Africa**

> #### Morphological Trends in Hominin Evolution
>
> **<u>Mosaic evolution</u>** - major evolutionary changes tend to take place in stages, not all at once; bipedalism; increased brain size; intelligence; relative vs absolute
>
> - Quadrupedalism vs **bipedalism** - difference in body and skull shape (foramen magnum, knees, hallux, hands, pelvis)
> - Changes in Hominin Brain Size: **large increases beginning around 1.8 MYA,** after very little variation from 3.3 – 1.8 MYA

- *Ardipithecus ramidus* & *Ardipithecus kadabba*: Middle Awash, Ethiopia

### Ramidus: 4.4 MYA; Kadabba: 5.8-5.6 MYA

- Teeth and fragments of various upper and lower bones; both ape-like traits (thin enamel) and hominin-like traits (canines have reduced sexual dimorphism, bipedalism)

### Australopithecines afarensis 3.6 MYA & Tanzania 4.2-3.0 MYA

<img src="https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/008eGmZEly1gpm96eeod1j30m80eqtae.jpg" alt="Australopithecines" style="zoom:25%;" />

- **==The first “Real” Humans==**: *Australopithecus afarensis*: Ethiopia (Hadar, Omo, and Fejej) 
- Many specimens; complex morphology exhibiting some ape-like traits (sagittal crests) and hominin-like traits (valgus knee; indicative of bipedalism)
- Either one single, sexually dimorphic species or 2 species was find 3.6 MYA in Laetoli
- They emonstrate that early hominins were **==bipedal==** (**big toes** hardly diverged from the rest of the foot), unlike in chimpanzees; gait was “heel strike” followed by “foot fall”

> Recent Discovery: **Selam** (peace)
>
> - fossilized skull & skeletal remains of 3-year-old female. Dated to 3.2 MYA
> - **Hyoid bone**: typical ape morphology
> - **Foot & Lower limb remains**: bipedal locomotion; 
> - **Scapula & Hand bones**: gorilla-like scapula and long and curved manual phalanges
>
> Other Australopithecines discovery
>
> - Gracile Australopithecines: *afarensis*, *africanus*; 
> - Robust Australopithecines: *boisei*, *robustus*, *aethiopicus*

### *Australopithecus sediba*: Malapa, South Africa around 1.98 MYA

> Discovery of 9-year-old son of researcher; juvenile male (MH1) and adult female (MH2) [controversial]
>
> - **Brain**: human-like in shape, yet < brain volumes in *Homo*; 
> - **Hand**: good for tree-climbing, and long thumb and short fingers (precision gripping); 
> - **Pelvis**: more human-like than ape-like; 
> - **Conclusion**: unique form of upright walking, not quite like that of humans, along with some degree of tree climbing

# Australia and the Americas

`March 25`

## Peopling of Australia: 50-60KYA

- Older than stated in textbook, due to recent evidence
- Wallace Line means boat travel (first peoples came by boat, there was no land bridge in recent history)

### What do these early sites look like?

- **Rock shelters**; seem to be among earliest peoples in the world to process grasses into flour and meal
- Built landscapes and plant and animal management: shellfish harvesting; most commonly used fire to remove unwanted brush/vegetation
- <u>Rock Art</u>: oldest rock art ca. 17 KYA; oldest dated rock art is a kangaroo; dates acquired by C14 dating of wasp nests on top of and beneath painting; pigments: minerals (such as ochre) and plant materials or wax

#### Clovis-First Hypothesis:

- Idea that people arrived in Americas during late Pleistocene, ca. 13.5 KYA; big-game hunters; making projectile points called Clovis points
- **Components to this hypothesis:**
  1. Bering Land Bridge (Beringia): Russia and Alaska used to be connected by land until about 11 KYA
  2. Ice Free Corridor: about 14 KYA glaciers begin to melt; people travelled through the corridor; believed to be impossible for any human activity in North America before 13.5 KYA

### Monte Verde at least 14.5KYA: 

- Chile; pre-dates Clovis points (such sites known as pre-clovis); evidence for **woodworking**, skins; not big-game hunters, **rather harvested plants; wood tools, not stone**
- *Pedra Furada*: Brazil; elaborate rock art panels; rock art ca. 12KYA; site often considered problematic (one hearth produced a date of 30 KYA)

### Many sites in the Americas that seem to predate 18KYA

#### Coastal Migration Hypothesis:

- Coastally-adapted people arrive by boat; kelp highway; glacial refugia (little islands of unglaciated land; appear to be habitable)

#### Domestication of Plants in the Americas

- Earliest domesticates are gourds, squashes; two locations: coastal plain of Peru (ca. 8-10KYA) by sedentary peoples; highland Mexico (ca. 10KYA) incorporated into practice of mobility
- Maize; highland Mexico ca. 6KYA; sedentary villages begin about 3500 years ago

- From Teosinte to Maize, changes in: stalk; single male inflorescence (tassel); development of husks; tough rachis; multiple rows of kernels; soft glumes
- *Caral*: ca. 6200 years old: maize spreads into South America in semi-domesticated form; example: Caral and other Cotton Pre-ceramic sites; maize agriculture and marine resources

#### Large Centres in Mesoamerica Olmec

- Legal-ritual centres (may or may not be cities); examples: La Venta and San Lorenzo
- *La Venta*: monumental architecture and statuary (large pyramid, and basalt faces); likely inhabited only by elites, around 1000 people
- <u>Mesoamerican Ball Game</u>: played by elites; shaped like “I”
- The Americas North of Mesoamerica: importance of mast forest resources (like acorns); evidence of controlled burns
- <u>Mounbuilding</u>: begins 7000 years ago in a number of locations; Lower Mississippi

#### Poverty Point (Louisiana): built to incorporate pre-existing mounds

- Poverty Point Construction Sequence: construction begins here ca. 3600 years ago; built in stages; Mound B and ridges (after 3400 cal. BP); Mound A (3200 cal. BP); BP = before present
- Mound A (Bird-shaped mound): estimated to have been built in 30-90 days
- Poverty Point as Pilgrimage *Centre*: materials coming from all over North America
- Newark Earthworks: ca. 2000 years ago; part of “Hopewell”; one example of many earthworks that were constructed in the Ohio valley (and elsewhere); mostly wild resources, but some Eastern Agricultural Complex plants
- Maize in North America: in southwest ca. 3.6KYA; Eastern Woodlands 2.3KYA; maize becomes focus of many economies ca. 1200-1000 years ago
- Chaco Canyon: Ancestral Pueblo fluorescence in building **great houses** ca. AD 1050; at least 12 such great houses inside the canyon, over 100 outside the canyon

#### Great Houses

- Multi-storied structures (largest is up to 5 stories tall with over 500 rooms); plazas; kivas (one structure has around 17)
- Built with astronomical alignment (align with phases of the sun/ cycle of the moon); seen as important trade centre for Mexican goods (copper, cacao, macaws)
- No evidence for domestic activities; found evidence for storage; likely houses for a few elite families; enormous amounts of turquoise found

#### Influence of Mexico

- Similar architectural style to that of northern Mexico; evidence of cacao plant
- Chaco Influence: Northeast and Eastern extremes marked by Great Houses; example: Chimney Rock
- Cahokia: 3 sprawling urban centres near border of Illinois/Missouri; AD 1054; “Big Bang”; 10k to 15k people in Cahokia; surrounding area: 40k
- Downtown Cahokia: Monks Mound and Plaza; laid out among cosmological principles; surfaces alternate between clay and sand; thought to improve durability

#### Cahokia believed to be at centre of Mississippian world

- Mississippian Material Culture: Ramey-incised vessels; triangular points: serrated edge points; shell from Gulf Coast; sinistral or lightening whelk

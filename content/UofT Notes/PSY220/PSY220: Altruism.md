# Cynical & Positive views of Altruism

- *Prosocial Behavior* - any act performed with the goal of benefiting another person
- *Altruism* - **unselfish** behavior that benefits others without a regard to consequences for oneself

## Cynical View

- One help other because human beings are selfish
1. **Social rewards** motive - people are motivated to help others to obtain social rewards
2. People are motivated to help others in need to **reduce their own distress**
3. Inclusive Fitness (evolutionary)
    - Then tendency for people to look out for themselves, their offspring, and their **close relatives**, together with their offspring, ensuring that their genes survive
    - Evidence: people receive more help from close kin than distant relatives or non-relatives
4. Reciprocal Altruism
    - The behavior whereby someone acts in a manner that temporarily reduces their own fitness while increasing another's fitness, with the **expectation that the other will act in similar manner at a later time**


## Positive View

Relateness of A and B /=> Benefit to B > Cost to A

```
- one help other not out of self-interest, but purely to assist others

- Empathy contagion - feeling what the other person is feeling (if you are sad I am sad)
- Perspective Taking - understand what the other person is thinking (己所不欲 勿施于人)
- Pro social Behavior - desire to alleviate the other person's suffering

    - Individual differences
    - **Situational influences** (willing help study on podcast)

### Situational Influences

- *Bystander* intervention
    - Assistance given by a witness to someone in need
    - helping is reduced when others are around
    - Minimizing
        - Make sure people can see other's initial reactions
        - Communicate when in the presence of friends
- Diffusion of responsibility
    - a reduction in the sense of urgency to help someone in an emergency based on the assumption that others who are present will help

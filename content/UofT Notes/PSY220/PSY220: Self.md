## Characteristics of Self

- **Distinct entity**, separated from other things or people
- Contains multiple sets of beliefs
- Organizes knowledge and information about one's self
- Influences how a person think, feel, and behave

## Social Psychology Perspective

- Concept coined by [[William James]]
- **The self is inherently a *social construct*** <!-- * **-->
- The concept is derived from others or  one's relationship to others
- The self would be influenced by the [[Context]]
- There are *4 major components* that construct the social self

# Self-Concept

##### Self ★
> ------------------------------------------------------------
> *Self* is a **concept**, a set of beliefs and perceptions one have about themselves
>

- Give rise to [[Self Schema]] a cognitive structure that represents the self

## 3 Types of Selves

- *Ought* - the self one that one **think they should be**
- *Actual* - the self that one **actually is**

## Cultural Influences

`Related Studies`: [[Pen Study]]
- The self-concept is always changing according to the influence of situational [[Context]], culture is an important factor
- **Independent**
    * Present in [[individualist cultures]]
    * Mostly present in "Western" cultures (Europe and North America)
    * Define self by traits and personal preferences
    * More stable across context
- **Interdependent**
    * Present in [[collectivistic cultures]]
    * Mostly present in "Eastern" cultures (Asian and South America)
    * Define self by social duties & shared traits/preferences
    * Less stable across context (more affect by it)

# Self-Evaluation (self esteem)

- Members of [[individualist cultures]] tend to report higher self esteem than members of [[collectivistic cultures]]
- One's self worth is **subject to change** on certain domains

## Sociometer Hypothesis

- **Self esteem** is an internal, subjective **index** or maker to which a person is included or looked **on favorably by others**
    * It is based on the success and failures in domains where a person places its self worth

## Social Comparison Theory
> By [[Leon Festinger]]

- People evaluate themselves through **comparisons to others**
- *Downward comparison* (compare to people "worse" than you)
    * Pro: Fails to provide information on how to improve
    * Con: Boosts self-esteem
- *Upward comparison* (compare to people "better" than you)
    * Pro: Makes people feel bad about themselves
    * Con: Motivates self improvement

## High Self esteem
- May lead to high sensitivity to treats, insults, and challenges
- May reduce one's tendency to change things that are not going well
- Can lead to narcissism

# Self-Knowledge

## Dunning-Kruger Effect

- About *self-awareness*
- People with **low ability at a task overestimate** their own ability, and that people with **high ability at a task underestimate** their own ability

## Self Enhancement (bias)

> Most relevant to **emotional** responses for feedback about self

- Desire to maintain, increase, or protect one's **positive self views**
- Benefit of positive illusion
    * Increase positive mood, decrease negative mood
    * Help to respond to stress and increase persistence
    * Foster social bonds ==how?==

- *Better-than-average Effect* - If over than 50% of people feel that they are better than average, then there must exist a gap between "reality" and self "perspective"
- *Illusion of Control* - tendency to think that one have control of the situation when they do not
- *Unrealistic Optimism* - believe that one is less likely to experience negative event and more likely to experience a positive event

## Self Verification/Conformation

> Most relevant to **cognitive** assessment of validity of feedback about self

- People strive to **get others to confirm/verify their existing beliefs** about themselves
- Recall and attend more to self-verifying information or signals of identity
- Enter [[Close Relationships]] that help self-verify

How self enhancement and self verification plays together

| Personality | Good feedback | bad feedback  |
|-------------|---------------|---------------|
| Happy       | 🙁            | 😀 (accurate) |
| Depressed   | 🙁(accurate)  | 😀            |

- Impression Management
    * Control how others view a "us"
    * Present **positive public face**
- Self Monitoring

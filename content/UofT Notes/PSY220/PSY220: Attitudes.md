##### Attitudes
> ------------------------------------------------------------
> A psychological construct that represents your **evaluations** (like or dislike) of people, objects, and ideas.
>
> ------------------------------------------------------------


# Elements of Attitudes

1. *Affect* (emotions) ^82a2e2
2. *Cognitions* (thoughts) ^bb0a3c
3. *Behaviors* ^105ac8

## Measurements of attitudes

- Self-reported measures: evaluate on a set of scale (ex. Likert scale $1-10$) [most common]
- Implicit measures: indirect measure of attitudes that does not involve self-report ex:
    * Response latency test
    * [[Out-Group#Implicit Association Test|IAT]]
    * Measure physiology (change in heart rate...)


# Origins

1. Personal experiences
2. Social learning
3. Genetic factor
4. Evolutionary factors


# Attitudes =/> Behavior

- **Generally**, attitude does predict behavior, its just that it **isn't always the case**.

`LaPiere Study`
- Context: in the 1930s, there were strong *attitude* against Chinese people in U.S.
- <u>Method</u>:
    - LaPiere asked a Chinese couple to visit restaurants to see if servers were willing to serve. Only $1/251$ restaurant refused, others **served just as normal**.
    - After that, LaPiere sent letters back to these restaurant to ask whether why **would serve**, $225/251$ said they **wouldn't**, others were unsure, none said they would.
- <u>Result</u>:
    - Conclusion: attitude and behavior sometimes may not align together.
    - Reason: [[#^d85c97|they want to make money]]

`Ontario Bar Study`
- <u>Method</u>:
    - Researchers went into a bar and asked whether people would be object to use condom when having sex with the people next to them. $100\%$ said no, they would not object.
    - However, when filling out the survey, only $56\%$ have admitted using condom the last time they had casual sex, and only $26\%$ said they always used condom during their sexual engagements.
- <u>Result</u>:
    - Conclusion: strong attitude did not lead to behavior.
    - Reason: [[#^9f062d|conflicting attitudes]]

## Underlining Reason

1. Different attitudes can conflict with another. ^9f062d
2. General attitudes don't predict specific behavior well.
3. There are other powerful determinants of behavior. ^d85c97
4. Introspection influences attitudes.
    - `Attitudes toward remantic partners`
        * <u>Method</u>: First group: simply fill out their feeling of their relationship; $\quad$ Second group: fill out what they did, then fill out their feeling of the relationship
        * <u>Result</u>: 9 month later, researchers found out that first group were more accurate about their feelings and predictions
5. Many behaviours are automatic


# Behavior => Attitudes

```text
Behavior clashes with attitude => Discomfort => Cognitive Dissonance
```

- Special cases when behavior can actually predict some attitudes.
- ==Theory==: [[Cognitive Dissonance Theory]] ★

## Effort Justification

- Coping with [[Cognitive Dissonance Theory]] By [[Leon Festinger]]

- Attempts to reduce the dissonance produced by the effort or cost spent to obtain something unpleasant or disappointing

> Ex. Had a trip to Europe, but the weather was bad all the time, like raining.
> - Then, this person might say that raining is "meaningful" or it was "beautiful".
> - This way, they would feel like that he actually enjoyed the time there.

`Effort Justification Study`
- <u>Method</u>
    - Participants were told this was a Psychology of Sex Study. They need to go through a screen in order to get in the study.
    - Assigned group (**Female** Participants read words to **male** experimenter)
        - Control group: neutral words (chair, book, talk)
        - Mildly Demanding group: little embarrassing words (virgin, prostitude, petting)
        - Very Demanding group: obscene words or passage from a novel describing sexual intercourse
    - After , they were all invited to listen to a very boring lecture about sex of invertebrates.
- <u>Result</u>
    - The control group were least satisfied, the mildly demanding group were a little more satisfied, while the very demanding group rate the lecture were very interesting.
    - This is because the very demanding group **took a lot of effort** to get into the lecture, therefore, rating it higher would make them to feel better.


## Induced Compliance

- Coping with [[Cognitive Dissonance Theory]] By [[Leon Festinger]] and Merrill Carlsmith in paradigm [[Forced compliance theory]]

- Subtly compelling people to behave in a manner that is inconsistent with their beliefs, attitudes, or values in order to elicit dissonance (and therefore change their original view).

`Induced Compliance Study`
- <u>Method</u>
    - All participants were asked to do a really boring experiment, after that:
    - Control group were asked to tell other people about the experiment.
    - Group 1 were given $\$1$ to tell other people that the experiment was fun.
    - Group 2 were given $\$20$ to tell other people they the experiment was fun.
    - At the end, the researcher give a survey to ask how they felt in truth.
- <u>Result</u>
    - Control group rate the lowest
    - Group 2 (with $\$20$) rated a little below average.
    - Group 1 (with $\$1$) rated the highest, they felt the experiment was actually not bad.
    - This illustrated that Group 1 didn't gain a lot, but they wanted to feel good for their time, therefore, they ended up rating an boring experiment very high.

### System Justification

> Really world example of cognitive dissonance
- The ==theory== that people are motivated to see the **existing sociopolitical system as desirable , fair, and legitimate.**
- Even people with lower status in the legal system would still justify for the inequalities.

## Self-Perception Theory

- ==Theory== that people infer their attitudes from observing their behavior.

Difference in the theories

| Cognitive Dissonance                                          | Self-Perception Theory                                                                                      |
|---------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| - Change attitude to fit behavior (dissonance is unpleasant ) | - Unpleasant mental state no needed <br> - People didn't change attitudes, they inferred them from behavior |

### Reconciling the two theories ★

- *Cognitive Dissonance* - more applicable when behavior doesn't fit pre-existing attitude and attitude is important to [[Social Self#Self-Concept|self-concept]]
- *Self-Perception Theory* - more applicable when person has no strong prior attitude

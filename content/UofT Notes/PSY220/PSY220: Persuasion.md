- How can one persuade people, ==Theory==: [[Elaboration Likelihood Model]] â˜…


## Central vs Peripheral Routes

- Which route to make depends on 2 factors

1. *Motivation*: People need a reason to pay attention to the given message
2. *Ability*: People need to be able to evaluate the message

    | Motivation & Ability                                                                                          | Process                                                     | Factors Promoting Attitude Change                                         |

    | LOW <br> - Not personally relevant <br> - Distracted or tired <br> - Message incomplete or hard to understand | [[Elaboration Likelihood Model#Peripheral Heuristic route]] | - Source attractiveness <br> - # and length of arguments <br> - Consensus |

`Route to Persuation Stuy`

- <u>Method</u>
    - Participants read arguments for a policy that required comprehensive exam for all graduating seniors at university
    1. Manipulated the **relevance** of the policy (take action in 1 year or 10 years).
    2. Manipulated the **quality** of the policy (8 strong or weak arguments)
    3. In additional, Manipulated the expertise of the source (student vs professor)
- <u>Result</u>

        - The blue bars indicates the central persuasion route
        - The red bars indicates the peripheral route (aren't responding too differently)
    - <img src="https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/008i3skNgy1gxl57ig1ymj30s60gkaar.jpg" alt="result_2" style="zoom:33%;" /> (Relevance & Expertise)
        - The blue bars indicates the central persuasion route (aren't persuaded by source)
        - The red bars indicates the peripheral route


## Which route to choose

```text
Motivation & Ability [LOW] => Peripheral
Motivation & Ability [HIGH] => Central
```
- Generally, the **central** route is more ideal and lasts a longer time


# Characteristic of Persuasion

### Source

> The sources of persuasion indicates who is persuasive

- *Attractiveness* (ex. Ads show picture of more attractive people to persuade)
- *Credibility* (ex. Use expertise)
- *Certainty* (ex. Present a sense of confidence)

### Content(message)

- *Quality*
    - Highlight desirable **consequences** of taking action (ex. Ad to toothpaste can decrease cavities)
    - Straightforward, **clear**, and logical
    - Explicitly refute opposition
- *Vividness*
    - A single example or personal narrative with **emotional appeal** is more persuasive than statistical facts that are objectively more formative
    > **Collapse of Compassion** - "A single death is a tragedy; a million deaths is a statistic." - Stalin
- *Fear*
    - Fearful messages are highly persuasive
    - Important to **provide info on how to act** on the fear
    - Don't go too far on fear (**apocalypse backfires**, provokes skepticism)

`Smoking Study (focus on fear)`
- <u>Method</u>
    - Currently smoking Participants were separated into 3 different groups
        1. Fear only: shown a lung removed from a smoker
        2. Information only: shown a pamphlet with suggestions on how to quit smoking
        3. Both intervention: lung + pamphlet
    - Followed up on the smoker's status
- <u>Result</u>
    - Info only group smoked $14$ cigarettes per day
    - Fear only group smoked $6$ cigarettes per day
    - Both group smoked $4$ cigarettes per day

### Receiver

 - *Need for Cognition* (one of a person's personality trait)
    - Extent to which individuals are inclined towards effortful cognitive actives (constantly asking why)
    - People high in need for cognition are more persuaded by high-quality arguments and less moved by peripheral cues
- *Age*
    - Younger people more easily persuaded
    - Dangers of children as eye witness
    - College students have dynamic attitudes (attitudes change)
- *Mood*
    - People who are in a good mood are more easily persuaded


# Resistance to Persuasion

- *Knowledge* - more Knowledge is better to resist
- *Previous Commitments* - making attitudes public makes them harder to change
- *Attentional Biases* - by [[Social Self#Self Verification Conformation|conformation bias]]
    - Selectively attend to and evaluate info that confirms their attitudes
- *Attitude Inoculation*
    - Small attacks on people's beliefs that engage their pre-existing attitudes, prior commitments, and background Knowledge, enabling them to counteract a subsequent larger attack and thus resit persuasion.

`Attitude Inoculation Study`
- <u>Method</u>
    - Phase 1: "It's a good idea to brush your teeth"
    - Phase 2:
        - Group 1: "Refute Small attacks: Too frequent tooth brushing can hurt your teeth"
        - Group 2: No attacks
        - Group 3: Review suporting evidence
    - Phase 3: Full scale attack on their attitudes
- <u>Result</u>
    - After Phase 1: $12/14$ people thought the tooth brushing is good
    - After Phase 2:
        - Group 1: $10/14$ still support
        - Group 2: $6/14$ still support
        - Group 3: $6/14$ still support

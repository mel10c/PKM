# Groups

## Influence on the individual

##### Group
> ------------------------------------------------------------
> - A collection of individuals that are *interdependent* to each other in some degree
> - A collection of individuals who perceive some level of *entitativity* (a group considers themselves to be a entity with unity and coherence)
>
> ------------------------------------------------------------

- *Ultrasociality* - a collective organization with **full division of labour**
    * 1000 (or more) individuals living together
    * In all other ultrasocial species, most individuals are cloesly related (genetically)
    * Groups are an **adaptation** that enables humans to be ultrasociality
- Advantage of group living (evolution + psychological)
    1. **Protection** from predators
    2. Easier to obtain resources
    3. **Assistance** in child rearing
    4. Defense against other groups
    - Also fulfills the psychological [[Close Relationships#Need to belong|need to belong]]
- Disadvantage of group living
    * Intergroup **competition** and **status differentials** can emerge
    * Dominant and dominated groups can emerge (race, socioeconomic status)
    * Intergroup bias ([[Out-Group#Stereotyping|stereotyping]], [[Out-Group#Prejudice|prejudice]], [[Out-Group#Discrimination|discrimination]])

### Zajonc's Model (social facilitation) ★

Answers: do we behave better when others are present

> `Others presence => Arousal => Strengthens dominant responses`
> - Dominant response is *correct* (enhance easy behavior)
> - Dominant response is *incorrect* (impairing difficult behavior)
- This implies that when there are mere presence of others, **people do better or simple or well-learned tasks, and worse for difficult or novel tasks**
- `Related Study` The cockroach study

### Other aspect of social facilitation

- *Evaluation Apprehension* - concern about looking bad in eyes of others (sense of [[Social Self#Social Comparison Theory]])
- *Social loafing* - the tendency to exert less effort when working on a group where individual contributions cannot **not be monitored**
- *Deindividuation* - the reduced sense of individual identity ans self control that occurs in large groups (**impulsivity, irrationality, emotionality, antisociality**)
    * Individuation - enhanced individual identity produced by focusing attention of the [[Social Self#Self ★|self]]
- Spotlight effect - conviction that other people are paying attention to them more than they actually are

## Group decision-making

### Group Think

- Conditions to make group think worse:
    * High cohesiveness, Insulation, Lack of procedures for search and appraisal of information, High stress, strong leaders
    * **Emotional factor is dominant**
- Symptoms
    * Illusion invulnerability/moral superiority, Pressure on dissenters/self-censorship, Collective rationalization< Stereotypes out-groups,Illusion of unanimity
- Effects
    * Poor information search
    * Shallow examination of information
    * Narrow consideration of alternatives
    * Bias in processing information
    * Failure to work out contingencies
- Preventing
    * Leader refrains from making opinions known
    * Introduce people into the group at different stages
    * Designate a devil's advocate
- **Summarize**: group decision making sometimes can be bad
- Connected to the thesis of the book: [[乌合之众]]

### Polarization

- *Group Polarization* - tendency for group decision to be more extreme than those made by individual
- Connected to the thesis of the book: [[乌合之众]]


## Group organization

### Leadership types

- Almost all groups have **hierarchies** (leader would likely to emerge)
- Characteristics of leader
    * Relevant skills
    * Good social skills
    * Altruistic
- Different types of ways for leader to emerge
    * *Authority* - power drives from **institutionalized** roles
    * *Dominance* - behavior enacted with the goal acquiring or demonstrating power
    * *Status* - evaluation by others (been respected, and have prominence)
    * *Power* - ability to control one's own outcomes and those of others

### Danger of power

- Power vs Status
    * Low status and high power can be threatening and aversive
    * High status and low power can result n people acting o their internal states and feelings

- <u>Approach/inhibition Theory</u>
    * High-power people inclined to go after their goals and make quick (sometimes rash) judgments (**approach**)
    * Lower-power inclined to constrain their behavior & pay careful attention to others (**inhibition**)
- Alternative idea: power makes people more like **who they really are**


# Cultural

## Human Capacity for culture

- [[Cultural Psychology]] - The study of psychology and behavior are influenced by culture

## Cultural dimensions

`Hofsted's IBM Study`

1. *Power distance* - extend to which power and status differences are accepted and sanctioned in society
2. *Uncertainty Avoidance* - extend to which uncertainly and ambiguity are tolerated
3. *Masculinity/Femininity* - extend to which traditional masculine values, like aggressiveness and assertiveness are valued
4. *[[individualist cultures]]/[[collectivistic cultures]]* - extend to which the [[Social Self#Self ★|self]] or the [[Group and Culture]] constitutes the center point of identification for the individual ^08ef99

- Criticism
    * Single company's data (strong corporate culture, western company)
    * There are other dimensions
    * Partial geographic coverage
    * Measures are attitudinal not behavior


### Bicultural People

### Naive Dialecicism

1. Principle of change - reality is not static but in process of constant change
2. Principle few contradiction - reality is not precise and clear, but is full of contradictions
3. Principle of [[Context]] (or holism) - parts are meaningful only in their relations

## Many types of cultures

### Evolutionary basis 
- Human exist today because ancestors have close relationships can **ensures infants are protected** and pass on the genes
- Need to belong is **universal** - across all cultures
- Desire to belong should be **satiable** - need that can be fulfilled 
	* People tend to need around **6 friends** (when this number is met, people's desire to get friends can decrease)
- If unmet, human will suffer profound negative consequences (proof: interview with prisoners that are confide in war)



## Attachment Theory ★

## Investment Model of Commitment

---
- `(1) Satisfaction (2) Investments (3) Alternatives => commitment => Stay or leave`

# Attraction

## Proximity

- `Westgate Housing Study`
    * How do people become **friends**
    * Campus was close, and people when they come in are all strangers
    * **Increased opportunity to meet people who live close to each other**
    * People tend to like novel stimuli more after, people have been repeatedly exposed to them - [connect to Mere Exposure Effect]
- `Mere Exposure Effect`
    * The tendency for novel (new) stimuli to be liked more after people have been **repeatedly exposed** to something/someone
    * This is an correlational effect, therefore hard to tell if likeness => exposure, or exposure => likeness

## Similarity

- People tend to select pets that "looked similar" to themselves 
- A `study` included 1000 sets of couples, and did a survey with 88 characteristics. 
    * Found out that couples have similarities then random paired people
    * More similarity on demographic and health characteristics

- Why
    * Similarity fluency in interactions 
    * Similar people have characteristics people like about themselves
    * Similarity triggers [[Social Self#Self Verification|social validation]]

## Physical attractiveness

- Qualities that predict physical attractiveness
    * People tend to rate the "*average*" face more attractive
    * *Facial symmetry* tend to to correlates with higher physical attractiveness
    * These characteristics are **cross cultural** 

- Early benefits of higher physical attractiveness
    * Nurses are more responsive to "cuter" babies
    * Attractive babies receive more attention from their mother
    * More popular in preschool
    * Elementary teachers assume attractive children are more intelligent
- Later benefits
    * More attractive people tend to have a higher income
    * Physically attractive people are more **socially skilled**
    * Develop good social interaction skills and report more satisfying interactions (they get more experience)
    * Are treated differently (receive positive reactions)

- `Halo Effect` - belief that attractive people possess a host of positive qualities belong their physical appearance 
- `Closing-Time Effect`
    * Done in 1979
    * Men and women rated other people's attractiveness at 3 different times (21:00, 20:30, 00:00)
    * Participants rated the opposite sex are the same around (21:00- 22:30)
    * Then rated the opposite sex as the night gets further on (running our of the time)
    * This is the [[Context|power of situation]]
- The gender difference between choosiness 
    * Biologically female would invest more in an relationship (more choosy)
    * *Men* tend to seek out for **more partners have more offspring** 
    * *Women* tend are **more choosy with the best partner**
    * Men favor **younger** & physically attractive
		* The average age partner that men prefers tends to stay at 20-24
    * Women seek older mates with **good** financial prospects, high status, slightly older & ambition  
		* The average age partner that women prefer goes along their own ages
- Critique about the evolutionary gender differences perspective 
    * Women pair with higher status men because they are often more attractive (based on similarity)
    * Since women are caregivers, they select the opposite sex based on their resources to meet their own needs
    * Evolutionary perspective too for from now

## Physical arousal 

- `Bridge Study`
    * After men cross one the two bridges (safe vs scary), they are approached by a attractive female with her phone number
    * Results: about >10% of the men in the safe bridges called the experimenter, whereas 50% of the men in the scary Bridge called the experimenter

                    How explicit is the pressure from others
```

- *[[#Conformity]]* - changing one's behavior of beliefs in response to real or **imagined pressure** from others (norms)
    > Ex. Asks a beer at party
- *[[#Compliance]]* - responding favorably to an **explicit request** from another person
    > Ex. Not in mood to go out to drink, but friends asks, you said yes
- *[[#Obedience]]* - In an **unequal power** relationship submitting to the demands of the person in authority
    > ex. Go to a party when boss asks to have drink with them

# Conformity

- Pros: want norms to exist that are beneficial or safe for the group members
    > Ex. drive inthe right side of the road
- Cons: people can act badly due to desire to fit in
    > Ex. drink too much, Nazy Germany

- *Automatic Mimicry* - imitating of other's behavior without conscious awareness`

`Study of Automatic Mimicry` <!-- ` -->
- <u>Method</u>
    - Participants were asked to do certain tasks in a room with experimenter (sitting).
    - They were looking through photos.
    - Experimenter were mimicking other person
- <u>Result</u>
    - Mimicking people makes people feel accepted
    - Not mimicking might cause destructive of norms

### Informal vs Normative

| Informational                                                                        | Normative                                                                                          |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Actually **accepting and internalizing** other people's perceptions, even in private | Agreeing with the position in public, even if we continue at **believe something else in private** |

## Informational social Influence

- The influence of other people the results from taking their comments or actions as a **source of information** about what is correct, proper, or effective.
    - Want to know what's right
    - People are **uncertain of their views**

- `Related Studies`: [[Sherif's Study]]

## Normative Social Influence

- The influence of other people that comes from the **desire to avoid their disapproval** and other social sanctions (ridicule, ostracism)
    - People want to fit int and be liked
    - People have **strong opinions**

- `Related Studies`: [[Asch Conformity Experiment]]

## Factors promoting conformity

1. Group size (within 4 people, then not too much difference)
2. Group unanimity
3. Expertise and status (expert's opinion are taken more seriously)
3. Being from an interdependent culture ([[collectivistic cultures]])


# Compliance

## Cognitive approach

- *Reciprocity(互利)* - people should provide benefits to those who benefits them
    > People are more likly to buy somehting from store that has free sample
    > People who recieved gifts with donation letter are more likely to domate (sense of obligation)
- *Door-in-the-face* - start with extreme request that is sure to be rejected and then ask for smaller request (the one wanted all along)
- *Foot-in-the-door* - start with small request that almost everyone will agree to, then a larger request (the one wanted all along)

## Mood/Emotion approach

- Positive mood that increase compliance
    - Mood colors interpretation of request (think that request nature is good)
    - Mood maintenance (say yes make people feel good)
- Negative mood that increase compliance
    - Negative state relief (say yes make people feel better)
    - Guilt (more obligated)

`Shopping Study`
- <u>Method</u>
    - Participants were asked to take picture in store
    - Then they were told that they broke the given camera
    - Then the experimenter provided an actor that needed help
- <u>Result</u>
    - Participants were more likely (50%) to help than the control group (15%) after the bad mood

## Norm approach

- Use the norms approaches grounded to make people compliance
- ‼️Careful‼️ - highlight norms in good way, not bad way (so **don't promote  bad behavior as norm**)

> Ex. Make like most people use reusable towers a hotel, to make people more likely to reuse towers


# Obedience

- `Related Study`: [[Milgram Experiment]]

## Reduce obedience

- Tuning in the victim (physical closeness promotes empathy)
- Tuning out authority (physical distancing reduce fears of disapproval)

- Changing in implicit bias
    - What are the 2 **most effective** way to improve implicit bias:
        - Train one's mind to form association set of concepts (the core of IAT)
        - Invoke one's motivation (explicit or implicit) to change biases
    - What is the least successful ways to change bias
        - When people are induced with threat, will evoke biases
        - Self affirmation (reinforce self image)
        - Specific moods/emotions would not change biases much
    - What are the 3 puzzles about implicit bias and ways to resolve it
        1. Replicable implicit bias on **average for a group**, and constantly **shifting individual scores**
            - IAT might be helpful for indicating a group/culture context, but less useful for assessing individual differences
            - The individual differences cancels out/washed out in large group statistics
        2. Same effects across ages
            - > If one’s biases are not stable across a month, how can they be stable across a lifetime?
            - [[322 - L6#^85b107|Group Norm Theory]]: the dominate group will have the right to express and pass on their values (older onto younger generation) keeps consistency ^38f177
            - Developmental: values from the adolescent will continue
            - Measuring attitude specific moment in specific place, thus less associated with individual attitude across time
        3. Individual differences in implicit bias predict behaviour only weakly
            - Implicit bias much more strongly associated with disparate outcomes when examined at aggregate levels (nations, states, metropolitan areas)
            - IAT might be a better test for structural bias rather than individual bias, indicates more about the structure about group
    - What is the concept of accessibility
        - *Concept accessibility*
            - The likelihood that a thought, evaluation, stereotype, trait, or other piece of information will be **retrieved for use**
        - **NOT association** but **accessibility** of that association
            - Payne et al. propose that ` implicit bias` (measured by IAT) reflects the **accessibility** of concepts linked to a social category
    - What should be done for implicit bias training
        - On-going conversation, instead of one-case-only stereotypes
        - Examine the motivation factors to seek opportunities to induce change
        - Accessibility of bias links (simple awareness might induce further bias, but addition of motivation to change will make this effective)
- Masculine Defaults
    - What is the difference between masculine defaults and differential treatment?
        - 
            |                      | Masculine defaults | Differential treatment |
            |----------------------|--------------------|------------------------|
            | Definitions          | Characteristics and behaviours associated with the male gender role are **valued, rewarded, or _considered standard_, normal, neutral, or necessary** aspects of a given culture  | Women are explicitly or implicitly **treated or judged more _negatively_ than men** |
            | Who is disadvantages | Women and men who have a **_mismatch_ with characteristics and behaviours associated with the male gender role** and women who encounter **backlash for not fitting the female gender role** | Women |
            | Result               | Historically-derived cultural ideas that characteristics and behaviours associated with the **male gender role are _superior_ or necessary**, standard, neutral, or normal; neglecting ways that women on average differ from men | Historically-derived cultural ideas that **women are less competent** and do not fit into majority-male cultures |
            | Looks like           | Absence of negative treatment or judgment of women and thus **may not appear overtly discriminatory on surface** | Explicit or implicit negative evaluation or mistreatment |
            | Assessment           | A cultural feature values, reward, or regards as standard, normal, neutral, or necessary characteristics and behaviours associated with the male gender role, even if it appears equitable on the surface | Women are treated or evaluated more negatively than men |
            | Remedy               | Creating a balanced culture that **does not privilege characteristics and behaviours associated with the male** gender role over those associated with the female gender role OR **disassociate gender role** with characteristics, make them neutral | Eliminating negative treatment or judgment of women relative to men | ^fc6813
- Coalitions & Well-being
    - *Well-being*
        - Self-esteem, depression, anxiety, life satisfaction, control, positive well-being, positive affect, negative affect, stress, flourishing
        - Perceived discrimination does lead to worse well-being (worse for minority groups than majority groups) 
        - Ingroup identification does not robustly buffer against this effect across samples
    - [[Social Self#Self Esteem]]
        - “There is ample evidence of ‘inferiority’ feelings and of morbid self-hate in all minority groups.” (Erikson, 1956)
            - Racial position model
        - “Group oppression may destroy the integrity of the ego entirely, and reverse its normal pride, and create a groveling self-image,” (Allport, 1954)
    - [[Self-fulfilling prophecies]]
        - Predicts: even if unaware of others’ negative expectations, a stigmatized person will come to see themselves in ways consistent with negative stereotypes
        - Perceiver acts on initially false beliefs in a way that leads the target to behaviourally confirm this belief
    - Efficacy-based self-esteem approaches
        - The self-concept develops through efficacious interaction with the environment. Blocks to interacting successfully with environment prevent development of high self-esteem
        - Predict: Limitations on stigmatized people’s opportunities to control environment lead to low self-esteem
    - ==Rejection-identification model==
        - Perceived discrimination may lead to increased ingroup identification for minority group members 
        - Ingroup identification can then lead to greater self-esteem, thus buffering the negative effect of discrimination
- Mechanism to protect self-esteem
    1. ATTRIBUTIONS
        - Attributing negative feedback to one’s group membership (i.e., “it’s not me, it’s them and their stereotypes of my group”)
    2. INGROUP COMPARISONS
        - Segregated environments (proximity effect): more likely exposed to ingroup than outgroup members (for some stigmas)
        - To obtain accurate self-evaluations (similarity effect): my group more similar on other attributes (e.g., comparing my salary to other women’s salary)
        - To avoid unpleasant or painful social comparisons (self-protective effect): avoiding painful comparisons with those who have had advantages you have not had
    3. SELECTIVE VALUING
        - Devaluing those performance dimensions on which they or their group fare poorly
        - Valuing those dimensions on which they or their group excels
        - Can be socially produced – receiving feedback (positive or negative), comparing to others, being discriminated against or advantaged in certain areas
        - Prediction: to the extent that members of stigmatized groups do poorly, are targets of negative feedback, or receive poor outcomes because of prejudice, they will place less importance on this dimension than will individuals who are not stigmatized

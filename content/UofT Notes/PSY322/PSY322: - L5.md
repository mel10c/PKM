# Lecture

- `PDF`: 
    - [[322 - S5.pdf]]
- Threat-Based Approach
    - What does negative [[Prejudice]] mean?
        - Negative feelings toward all sorts of social groups based on ethnicity, immigration status, gender or sexual minority, etc
    - What are the recurrent **adaptive problems** of social life?
        - Functional evolutionary approach
            - Left-over effect
            - Stereotyping and prejudice may be **psychological mechanisms** designed to help humans address these recurrent **adaptive challenges** (disease, health, physical danger, safety, reciprocity)
        - Error management
            - *Smoke Detector Principle*
            - Motivated to see people as threatening even if they are not
            - Threat as perceived threat rather than actual threat
            - `Overly sensitive > Under sensitive`: assume harmless is dangerous OR Assume dangerous as harmless
        - Behavioural immune system
            - Avoid contact with people who may be sick; overly inclusive
            - Emotional evoked for threatening to health is predominately **disgust**
            - Sensitive to cues of illness
    - Call back to [[Affordance management]]
        - People perceive groups to pose different threats and positive opportunities
        - Stereotypes of specific threats (belief) `-->` specific prejudice (emotions)
        - *Fear, disgust, anger* tend to be common emotion, leads to different behaviour
            - Physical danger `-->` fear `-->` violence, aggression
            - Disease, value difference `-->` disgust `-->` 
            - Goal obstruction `-->` anger `-->`
    - Implications
        - **Who** are more likely to contain prejudice?
            - People who feel **vulnerable** to a *specific threat* will be **more prejudiced** toward groups seen to pose that threat
        - **When** are people likely to contain prejudice
            - *Situations* that make **particular threats salient** will result in **prejudice** toward groups stereotyped as threatening
        - Threat to reciprocity
            - Groups stereotyped as unwilling or unable to contribute their "fair share" to the larger group
        - Within group threat perceiving
            - What threats does Group A perceive Group B to pose?
                - Predicts specific prejudices (fear, anger, disgust)
                - Predicts specific behaviours (policy support, forms of discrimination)
- [[Social Dominance Theory]] (SDT)
    - What are some main ideas about SDT
        - > "Group base hierarchies is the base for stereotype problems, its inevitable; but on an individual level, one could choose to ascribe to this measure"
        - All human societies tend to be structured as systems of group-based **hierarchies** (*dominant groups* and *subordinate groups*)
        - Dominant group has **disproportionate share of all material** and symbolic things for which people strive 
        - In a group-based hierarchy: people are afforded power, prestige, etc. by virtue of group membership
    - What are 3 types of hierarchy
        - Age system
        - Gender system
        - Arbitrary set system
            - Any relevant group distinction that the human **imagination** is capable of constructing
            - SDT: systems of arbitrary set hierarchy will emerge whenever there is economic surplus
    - Reasons for inevitability
        - Unequal distribution of resources `-->` group-based inequality
        - Group-based inequality `-->` justification of inequality to maintain dominance
        - People at the top will use legitimizing myths to justify their dominance
            - These myths will spread to subordinate groups, not just an ingroup/outgroup dynamic
    - What predicts higher SDO?
        - Being in a dominant group 
        - Socialization processes (e.g., exposure to legitimizing myths) 
        - Temperamental predispositions (e.g., greater empathy = lower SDO)
        - Gender: men higher on SDO on average
            - Higher position in society (justifies dominance)
            - Greater competition for resources
        - Occupations that enforce hierarchies

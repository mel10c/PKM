- Moral Credentials
    - Many people seek to maintain a non-prejudice;d self image
    - When they have recently had an opportunity to act non-prejudiced, concern is temporarily lifted
    - Acting non-prejudiced = “moral credentials”
    - Implication: Does this idea mean people may be more likely to act prejudiced if they perceive themselves to have enough moral credentials?
    - Takeaway: People are **_more likely_ to express bias when they have established moral credentials**
- Motivations to avoid prejudice ^3be23d
    - *Internal*: motivated to behave in accordance with **personally** held nonprejudiced beliefs
        - Lead to more focus on the needs of their interaction **partner**, remember more of what the interaction partner shares
        - Lead to focus on **approaching a positive interaction**, treating interaction partner with respect
    - *External*: motivated to respond without prejudice to **comply with nonprejudiced social norms** and to avoid disapproval from others
        - Lead one to focus on **themselves**
        - Lead one to **avoid responding** in a negative/prejudiced way

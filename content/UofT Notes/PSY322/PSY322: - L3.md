- [[Social categorization]] and [[Social Identity]]
    - What is social categorization and the most apparent features for categorization?
        - *Social categorization*: tendency to categorize **automatically** with minimal info
        - Social identity: born out of social categorization
        - Human detect race, sex, and age within milliseconds
        - [x] What are some similarities between them
    - What are some importance of categorization?
        - ★ **Precursor** to [[Stereotype]] and [[Prejudice]]
    - Perspective 1 on social bias: [[Realistic Conflict Theory]]?
        - `Conflit = Categorization + Competition`
        - Intergroup conflict emerges when groups have actual **conflicts of interest**
        - What are the 3 stages of [[Robbers Cave Study]]?
            1. Bonding (forming norms)
            2. Competition (friction)
            3. Reducing friction (mere contact + **common**, superordinate **goals**)
                - [[Mere Exposure Effect]] is not effective in this case
        - What is an example of resources in [[Realistic Conflict Theory]]
            - Focused on physical/tengable resources
            - Also applies for perceptual (intengable) resources (power)
        - Is there exist a [[203 - L3#^dfad38|temporal precedence]] with prejudice and conflict?
            1. Us vs. Them
            2. Idea that resource is limited, and competition is required
        - Can intergroup [[Bias]] emerge in the absence of competition?
            - Competition is not necessary, but its a 助燃剂
            - No competition still can arise dehumanization, out-group derogation
                - Out-group derogation can be benevolent, with reinforcing stereotypes
                - Hostile thoughts can be protective toward in-group competition/conflict
                - Benevolent thoughts can be protective with group dominance
            - Feelings of fear are an evolved skill to protect oneself, but contribute to biases
            - [[322 Quiz 1#^81fcce|Minimal group paradigm]]: bias can arise simply with existence of groups
        - What is the different in allocating resources between groups
            - People tend to prefer in-group favouritism  `>` derogate the out-group
            - People prefer to (**maximize the difference**) between in-group and out-group rewards than (maximizing joint profit or maximizing in-group profit)
    - Perspective 2 on social bias: [[Social Identity Theory]]?
        - `Conflit = Identification + Catorization`
        - What is the origin of in-group favouritism?
            - Identification as a group member, and strong motivation to keep positivity for group
        - [[Social identity]]: being part of a group is an important self concept
            - People strive to maintain **positive, distinctive** social identity
            - This can look like engaging in social comparisons
            - People show in-group favouritism , even when group memberships are arbitrary
            - Implication: **Conflict is not required** to create group identification and intergroup bias
    - What is ==Optimal Distinctiveness Theory== and its main ideas
        - One choose which group to identity with based on how they satisfy **both** need to *assimilate* and *differentiate*
        - [[individualist cultures]]'s need to differentiate can be more important than need to belong
        - [[collectivistic cultures]]'s need to differentiate can be less important than need to belong
        - What are some important contextual importance
            - Different context would lead to different preference on assimilate or differentiate or even different social identity
            - Idea of fashion can also be a example of balancing between assimilate and differentiate
            - Different context can be different identities more salient, thus "awaking" sense of identity
            - Level of consciousness `≠` Exposure (selective exposure) due to fear of stigma
    - What is group homogeneity
        - *Group homogeneity*: idea of people in targeted group are all the same
        - Stereotyping the average group member and perceiving more similarity in out-group members (“they” are all the same)
        - Out-group homogeneity especially likely when groups are **unfamiliar** and abstract (i.e., an ethnic or religious group one has never interacted with before)
        - In-group homogeneity is likely in those who especially identify with the in-group
    - What is cross-race bias.
        - > Result of out-group homogeneity in conceptual level
        - People are better at telling apart individuals of their own group than people in other groups
        - Cross-race bias (also called otherrace, or own-race bias): the tendency to more accurately recognize same race faces than other race faces
        - Importance
            - Miss-identification in legal level
        - Explanation
            - Perceptual expertise : people may be more likely to encounter people of their own race, more experience identifying and differentiating features and telling people apart
            - Social cognitive effects : outgroup targets are processed categorically while ingroup targets are individuated
- [[Stereotype]]
    - Where do they come from?
        - ★ Illusory correlation (false correlation)
            - 
              ```text
                  Negative behaviour by minority --> False attribution --> False perception
                ```
            - Stereotypes sometimes arise from faulty workings of human [[memory]]
            - Ones-shot: even with a lifetime of experience, people can encode just a single instance of behaviour as common or as rare
            - People spontaneously consider **group membership as a potential cause of a rare behaviour** when the behaviour is committed by a member of a rare group
            - Members of minority groups are at risk of generating one-shot illusory correlations whenever they engage in behaviour that lies outside of the mainstream
        - Social role theory
            - 
              ```text
                  Social role characteristics --> False Attribute --> False perception
                ```
            - One notice which groups disproportionately occupy certain roles in a society
            - One then infer that the attributes required of the role must be typical attributes of the group
        - Justifications of prejudice
            - 
              ```text
                  Knowledge (feelings + behaviour) --> Justification --> False cognition (attitude)
                ```
            - What are the primary functions of stereotypes
                - *Knowledge*: represent and streamline info about groups
                - *Justification*: rationalize observed or experienced group differences
                    - Rationalize discrimination
                    - Protect group-based inequalities
            - Could prejudice alone be enough to produce stereotypes?
                - 
                    ```ad-example
                    > Study looked at whether “created” prejudice would lead to the creation of stereotypes
                    - Method
                        - Two groups with no existing stereotypes: Moldova & Slovenia 
                        - “Created” prejudice with affective priming 
                        - Tested stereotypes along warmth and competence dimensions
                    - Results
                        - When a country was paired with the negative-affect face, its inhabitants were stereotyped lower in warmth compared to the inhabitants of positive-affect paired country
                        - This pattern was not observed for the competence stereotypes
                    ```

          ```ad-example
          Hiring (Hebl et al, 2002)
          > Goal: look at formal vs. interpsonal discrimination
          
          - Method
              - Participants wear different hat that indicated whether in-group or out-group
              - All other varaibles (interations, cloth, speach are controled)
              - Independent variable (questions):
                  - Do you have any job openings (*formal*)
                  - Could I fill out an application (*formal*)
                  - What sorts of things could I be doing if I worked here (*interpersonal*)
                  - Would you mind if I used your bathroom (*formal*)
              - Dependent variable (manager reactions)
                  - Audio recordings (have independent people rate the their reactions)
          - Measurement

                  - Word count
                  - Perceived negativity
                  - Coded negativity by independent raters
          - Result
              - **No significant difference** in formal disctrimination, but significant **differences in _interpersonal_ discrimination**.
            ```
    - What is [[Social categorization]]
- History of [[Prejudice]] and stigma research
    - How to study prejudice and stigma reflect in history (Duckitt, 1922)
        - Up to 1920s
            -  "Race theory": white domination, prejudice is not studied in academic
        - 1920s to 1930s
            - "*Irrational* prejudice": mental differences between race
                - Movement: challenging legitimacy of white colonial rule
        - 1930s and 1940s
            - [[Psychoanalysis|Psychodynamic]]: prejudice emerge from unconscious defense mechanisms
                - [[Psychoanalysis#Defense Mechanism|Defense mechanism]]: projection, scapegoating, displacement (Jewish are scapegoat of economic problems in Germany)
        - 1950s
            - "Individual differences": psychopathic tendency
                - Focus on authoritarian personality (Nazi selected people with authoritarian personality)
                    - It is hardly conceivable Nazi act were done by **normal** men
        - 1960s
            - "Social norms": prejudice are learnt, due to norms and lack of contact (integration solves the problem)
        - 1970s
            - "**Conflict** between interest": desegregation `-->` interracial conflict (contact is not enough)
        - 1980s
            - "[[Social categorization]]": prejudice is an outcome of natural processes that help us make sense of the world
            - *Symbolic racism*: instead of overt bigotry, racism is now more subtle and complex
    - What is stigmatization
        - *Stigma*: Some <u>attribute or characteristic</u>, that conveys a <u>social identity</u> or **_perceived_ group membership** that is **devalued** in a particular <u>social context</u>
        - an attribute that extensively discredits an individual, reducing him or her from a whole and usual person to a tainted, discounted on
            - Engulfs, reduced, and devalued a person into a single attribute
    - What are the 3 types of stigma
        1. Group stigmas: based on group membership
        2. Physical stigmas: based on disability
        3. Psychological stigmas: based on personal failure OR character flaw
    - Differentiate stigma vs. prejudice
        - *Stigma research*: focuses on the **target** perspective 
        - *Prejudice research*: focuses on the **perceiver** perspective
    - Differentiate [[Social categorization]] with [[Social Self|social identity]]
        - Why does categorization matter

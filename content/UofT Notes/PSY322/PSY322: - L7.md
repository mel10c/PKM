    - Some prejudice is **acceptable**
    - (Ofosu et all, 2019)
        - Same-sex marriage legalization was published in 2015. 
        - For states that passed legalization locally
            - Implicit bias and explicit bias both showed decrease of bias after legalization
        - For states that did not pass legalization locally
            - They all showed gradual decrease for prejudice toward gay people before federal legalization
            - After legalization, they showed increase in prejudice toward gay people
            - Reason
                - Stronger in-group belonging within states
                - Brought **attention** to this matter
                - Change in law that is very salient to citizen caused reversal effect
    - When we see reductions in explicit prejudice, what does that mean?
        - As norms change, people start to internalize norms, leading to increase/decrease prejudice (to match norm)
- Aversive Racism ^9aa9da
    - Define this term
        - > The racial attitudes of many Whites who endorse egalitarian values, who regard themselves as nonprejudiced, but who **discriminated in subtle, rationalizable ways**
        - *Aversive racists* recognize prejudice is bad, but they **do not recognize** that they are **prejudiced**
    - Aversive racist behaviours
        - `DONT`: discriminate when it would be obvious to oneself and others
        - `DO`: discriminate when bias is not obvious
    - How to assess subtle bias
        - IF `prejudice = attitude`: [[Implicit Association Test]]
            - Not a very useful measurement for personal bias measurement
    - Implicit bias training
        - Companies spend $8 billion USD on diversity training, often focusing on unconscious or implicit bias
        - How effect are interventions to change implicit bias?
            - Lipman (2018): https://time.com/5118035/diversity-training-infuriates-men-fails-women/
        - Meta-analysis: 492 studies (87,418 participants)
            - Implicit measures can be changed… but effects are often relatively weak
            - Most studies focused on producing short-term (within hours) changes with brief, single-session manipulations
            - Most successful: 
                - Associate sets of concepts
                - Invoke goals or motivations 
            - Least successful:
                - Induced threat, affirmation, or specific moods/emotions
            - We don’t really know how to change implicit bias beyond the short term
- Puzzles about implicit bias
- Bias of crowds
    - Measures of implicit bias are meaningful, valid, and reliable
    - BUT… contrary to most assumptions, they are meaningful, valid, and reliable measures of situations rather than persons

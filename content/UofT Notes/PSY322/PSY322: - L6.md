    - What are the 2 problems in traditional prejudice study?
        1. Studying one prejudice at a time
            - To really understand prejudice, should look at prejudice **toward many group**
        2. Decrease in expressed prejudice: read or just conforming to norms?
            - There are multiple explanations for decrease expression in prejudice: change in attitude or **internalization** of prevailing social norm OR **conformity** without internalization
            - Charlesworth & Banaji (2019)

                - [[Out-Group#Implicit Association Test]]
    - What new perspective did group norm theory propose?
        - *Socialization processes*: `my group believes = my belief`
        - Attitude toward other group
            - **Contact with the attitudes** toward these groups prevailing among the **older members** of the groups in which they develop
        - Changing **group norms will be easier** and possibly more effective **than changing individual attitudes**
    - What are some common "norms" that increase prejudice acceptability? ^a649ef
        - People are less acceptable for people who have **done** "*bad*" actions 
        - People are less acceptable for people who is *high on competence and low on warmth* (**disgust**)
        - People are less acceptable for people who **does not confront** *norm*
    - What are some implication for prejudice acceptability?
        - > Its **_ok_ to discriminate(hold prejudice)** known the unacceptability/break of [[social norm]]
        - The public expression toward groups is highly correlated with **social approval** of that expression
            - Expressing prejudice 
            - Evaluating scenarios of discrimination
            - Reacting to hostile jokes
        - The more **desirable** (i.e., valued) the group, the more people will wish to **follow** its lead
            - [[Need to Belong]]: higher motivation to belong, higher possibility to change
        - When people **identify with valued groups** that condemn a prejudice, they are likely to work to **internalize those attitudes** and reduce that prejudice
        - To change prejudice, **_change norms_** within valued groups
- Social structure and media
    - Interpersonal vs. Structure prejudice
        - Racism in contemporary society an **interpersonal phenomenon** that originates from [[Prejudice|prejudiced]] individuals ==OR== a **structural phenomenon** that originates in policies or laws that systematically disadvantage members of marginalized racial groups?\
    - What is the hierarchy-preserving homeostasis
        - Some actors embedded within the *larger system* (e.g., prosecutors) **maintain hierarchy**, whereas *others* (e.g., public defenders) *attenuate hierarchy*
        - People are assumed guilty by default, (powerful ones always have upper hand)
        - The system disproportionally favours the hierarchy maintainer
    - How to assess structure bias
        - Examine the **outcome**
        - Ex. disproportion imprisonment rate for black
    - What are some consequences for ignoring structure influences

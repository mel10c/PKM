        - Rationalization
            - Indicate that the company have intensions to promote diversity (credit for effort)
            - Diversity structures may be seen as an indicator of **diversity effort efficacy**, even if they don’t actually achieve equity
            - Diversity structures may be a function of **legal strategy** to inoculate a company against discrimination claims
                - Costs (financial & social) may be greater in claiming discrimination at a company that touts itself as promoting diversity
    - What are some important benefits and limits of diversity structures
        - Benefits
            - Changing norms
            - Raise awareness of biases
            - Trust among underrepresented groups
        - Limitations 
            - Study of 30 years’ data, 700 organizations
            - Outcome measure: change in % Black and White managers
            - Most diversity structures **_unrelated_** to actual diversity within the organization
                - Diversity trainings on reducing manager bias: associated with subsequent decreases in racial diversity
                    - Assigning people to do things they don't believe (no internal motivation), might elicit back fire effect (forced external pressure)
                    - Bringing attention to racial identity might leading to aversive racism (hyper vigilance/salient of bias)
                    - **Punishment** oriented

    - What are some common ways to reduce prejudice
        - Changing norms

            - | Feature                | Popular approach: reducing bias                          | Situationist approach: sidelining bias                                                                                                                                               |

            | Goal                   | To change the person, by training bias **out of the person** | To activate an **alternative working self** with ideal goals that are endorsed by the person and for which **bias would be not functional**, thereby reducing the impact of bias on behavior |
            | Focus                  | Individual differences                                   | Contextual differences                                                                                                                                                               |
            | Emphasis on bias       | Primary and explicit                                    | Secondary or absent                                                                                                                                                                  |
            | How people are treated | As problematic, with **deficits**                            | As good, with s**trengths that can be used** for working toward ideal goals                                                                                                              |
            | Primary outcomes       | Measures of bias in the person                           | Real-life consequences of bias of inherent importance                                                                                                                                |
        - Sidelining bias vs. Reducing Bias
            1. Treats bias as an **expression** of the working self; shifts responsibility and causality from dispositions (e.g., “racists”) to **bad contexts** (those that elicit biased selves and biased behaviours)
            2. **Aimed at expressions** and cycles of bias; not at reducing one’s capacity for bias
            3. Many *bias-reduction approaches* focus on **increasing awareness** and recognition of bias; the assumption is that people are morally bad and need to recognize it
    - Intergroup contact theory ^0a467b
        - What are some optimal conditions for itnergroup contact (Allport)
            - Equal status between the groups in the situation
            - Common **goals**
            - Intergroup **cooperation** (working together)
            - Support of authorities, law, or custom
        - What are some experimental results [Pettigrew & Tropp, 2006]
            - Meta-analysis
                - 713 independent samples from 515 studies, more than 250,000 subjects, from38 nations
            - Does contact reduce prejudice
                - `Yes`: with $r = -0.21$
            - Are all Allport's conditions required
                - `Not realy`, but help, with conditions: $r = -0.29$
            - Do people have to choose (selection bias) to have contact 
                - `Not really`, No choice: $r=-0.28$, given choice $r=-0.22$
- Improving intergroup relations
    - Who is prejudice reduction good for
        - Traditional focus (focus on the advantaged group point of view)
            - Reactions of historically advantaged groups to disadvantaged groups
            - Focused on antipathy (assuming antipathy leads to discrimination, conflict, etc.)
            - Model of social change: Psychological rehabilitation of advantaged group members
        - For disadvantaged group
            - Group members like advantaged groups more
            - Underestimate injustice and discrimination their group faces
    - Reconciliation
        - Canada
            - At least 150,000 First Nation, Métis, and Inuit students went through residential schools 
            - They experienced cultural genocide (e.g., removed students from their parents and communities, not allowed to speak nonEnglish or continue cultural practices)
            - Many studies abused, killed; last schools closed in 1990s
            - Survivors of Canada’s residential schools placed issue on public agena; led to 94 calls to action
    - Summary
        - Individual level: microinterventions (see Sue et al (2019)
        - Policy/group/structural level: Diversity structures, norms

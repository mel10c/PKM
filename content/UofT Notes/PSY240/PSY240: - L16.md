- What is the most important issue with diagnostic with [[Schizophrenia]]?
    - **Subjectivity**: Relies on a person's presenting symptoms
    - Reliable diagnostic `â‰ ` Valid diagnostic
    - Strategies to improve?
        - *Endophenotypes*: biological or behavioural predispositions that makes a disorder more likely
        - Examples
            - `Processing Speed`: slowness writing symbols paired with numbers ($71-75\%$)
            - `Sensory Gating`: Impaired ability to filter out redundant information ($63-80\%$)
            - `Verbal Memory`: Impaired learning and recall of words and stories ($62-75\%$)
            - `Dichotic Listening`: Impaired ability to attend to one message and ignore another ($50-71\%$)
            - `Phnemic Word Fluency`: Reduced ability to generate words rapidly ($53-64\%$)
            - `Continuous Performance Test`: Slow and inaccurate detection of specified letters ($52-62\%$)
- ==Etiology== Theories related to [[Schizophrenia]]
    - Psycho-social models
        - [[Carl Jung]]: collective unconscious (similar delusion contexts)
        - Social Drift: explain the connection of schizophrenia with poverty rates
        - Meehl's Theory
            - Schizogene `->` cognitive slippage `->` aversive drift `->` schizotype
    - [[Diathesis Stress Model]]
        - Inherited/fetal injury `->` "switches" in the brain turned on by stress 
        - Biological vulnerability inherited or acquired early in life
    - Biological factors
        - Genetic contribution
            - Fraternal twins & first degree relative $6-17\%$
            - Identical twins: $48\%$
            - Exposure to flu in utero
        - [[Brain]] related
            - Reduced grey matter volume (slower processing)
            - Activation of left temporal lobe: hallucination\
            - Amygdala & hippocampus
        - [[Dopamine]] Hypothesis
            - Dopamine dysregulation promote psychotic symptoms
            - Blocking dopamine receptors are effective in treating schizophrenia
- ==Treatment== for schizophrenia 
    - Antipsychotic medication
        - Promethazzine (anti nausea)
        - Chlorpromazine (used for mood disorders mania agitation)
            - 1st generation
            - Lots of side effects (motor dysfunctions, weight gain)
        - Risperidone & Olanzapine (symtom control with fewer side effects)
        - Ativan: anti-anxiety medication
    - Psychotherapy
        - Emotional disturbance
        - Psychotic symptoms
        - Social Disabilities
        - Risk of relapse
    - Cognitive
        - Promote independence
        - Stresses reduction
        - Function disability control
    - Family therapy
        - Involvement of family
        - Sense of family members

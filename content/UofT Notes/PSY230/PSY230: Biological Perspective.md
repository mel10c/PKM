# The Biological Basis

##### Eysenck's Model of Personality
> ------------------------------------------------------------
> - Personality traits determined by Biological and environmental factors
> - 2 Aspect to biological: heritability and physiological substrates
>   - Substrates: hormones and cortical arousal
>
> ------------------------------------------------------------

- Used criterion analysis, with the goal of having a small number of factors
    - Broken down to 3 traits: extroversion, neuroticism, pscychoticism
    - Developed around the same time as the [[Big-Five Model]]
- Argued that there are a healthier people and a less healthy population, based on reaction to stress
- **Problem**: problematic research method, leading to racism confusion regarding genetic IQ differences

## Biopsycholoscial Theory

^41c87f

> By Jeffery Gray, critical to Eysenck' theory

- Not focused on personality, related to approach and avoid motivation
- Critical of Eysenck's view of extroversion with relation to arousal
- Instead Gray sees as "opposite" system that can be activated in different situations

### Behavioural Activation System (BAS)

- Focused on gaining **reward**, extroversion and **impulsively**
    - Extroversion experience more positive emotion
- Related to approach motivation
- Negative behaviour: mental disorders (ADHD) and substance abuse
- Positive behaviour: goal oriented

### Behavioural Inhibition System (BIS)

- Focused on **punishment** (avoid punishment)
    - Responds to *negative cues* in one's environment
- Related to avoidance motivation
- Anxiety based and **neuroticism**

<u>Fight or Flight System</u>
- Repose to *threat*
- Fear based
- Connected to the automatic nevus system

## Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory

> ==Theory==: [[]]

- BAS: handles reaction to all **rewarding stimuli**; associated with extroversion
- BIS: handles **conflict** between FFFS (*avoidance*) and BAS (*approach*); which underlie anxiety
- FFFS: added "freeze" as a response; handles reaction to all aversive stimuli


# Genetic Studying Method

- *Genes*: does having a particular **variant of a gene** explain the likelihood of being high or low for a particular trait
    - Heritability coefficient
- *Neuroscience*: is there a relationship between specific brain regions or networks and personality
    - FMRI imaging, EEG
- *Physiology*: is there relationship between autonomic nervous system responses or euro endocrine responses and personality
    - Synthetic branches

## Heritability

> The difference between an inherited trait (average rate) and the heritability (variability) of a trait

- Trait and behavioral variation are almost always about **gene and environment interactions**

### Twin Studies

> |             | Monozygotic (identical) Twins | Dizygotic (fraternal) Twins |
> |-------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
> | Environment | Same                          | Same                        |
> | Genetic     | Same                          | Different                   |

> [!quote]
> Criticism:
> - Did not consider epigenetic
> - Assumption of similar environmental factors are the same with identical and fraternal twins
>     - Identical twins looks similar, and share the same sex, thus, they are treated **more similarity** then the fraternal twins
> - Shared placenta with some twins, where others did not
> - Pregnancy behaviour (environmental) factors are not considered for adoption cases

### Epigenetic

- *Epigenetic*: the study of **heritable changes** in gene expression or cellular phenotype caused by mechanism other than changes in the underlying DNA sequence
- *DNA methylation*: biological process by which methyl groups are **added** to the DNA molecule ^83517c
- *Histone modification*: can modify to **open or closed** chromatin states and thus activation or repression ^0034a7
- Environmental factors ^b5aa24
    - **Maternal behaviour** and gene expression
    - Childhood maltreatment and DNA Methylation
    - Chronic social defeat stress found to decrease expression of genetic are implicated in normal emotion processing

### Genotyping

- *Genotype*: the genetic composition of al living being
    - Identify gene associated with behaviour
    - Polygentic: multiple gene are associated with behaviour

> [!quote]
> Criticism
> - The association might exit, it they are relatively low ($<10\%$)
> - Might be too tunnel visioned in a particular gene

## Neurology

> The most common way of studying neurology is fMRI
> - Allow to see brain activity and volume of brain

- `Extroversion`: brain region involved in processing reward information
    - Connect to [[#Behavioural Activation System (BAS)]]
- `Neuroticism`: brain regions associated with threat, punishment, and negative affect
    - Connect to [[#Behavioural Inhibition System (BIS)]]
- `Agreeableness`: brain regions that process information about the intentions and mental states of other individuals
    - Compassion is a big part of of agreeableness and social interactions
- `Conscientiousness`: brain region involved in planning and the voluntary control of behaviour
    - Planning is a big part of conscientiousness

## Physiology

- The autonomic nervous system
    - Blood pressure; heart rate; galvanic skin response
- Hormones
    - Cortisol; testosterone; oxytocin

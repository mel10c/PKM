##### Personality
> ------------------------------------------------------------
> - Consistent behavior patterns and intra-personal processes originating within the individual
>
> ------------------------------------------------------------

- 人格是构成一个人的思想 情感和行为的特有模式 包含一个人区别与他们的稳定而统一的心理品质
   - 气质(temperament): 与生俱来的 无好坏之分 无到的评价的意义；具有稳定性 跨活动的一致性 [most unconscious; mostly nature] Choleric, Sanguine, Phlegmatic, Melancholic (couldn't get stable result for myself)
   - 性格(character): 表现为个人的道德品格和行为的风格 能够进行道德评价 [nature and nurture]
   - 人格 (personality) [mostly nurture] 独特性，**稳定性**，综合性，功能性

# Objective Tests

##### Objective Tests
> ------------------------------------------------------------
> Administering a standard set of items, each answered using a limited set of responses options. (Self-ratings)
> `stringly disagree ----- slightrly disagree ----- slighlty agree ----- strongly agree`
>
> ------------------------------------------------------------

- The term "*objective*" refers to the method used to **score** the responses, **not the response themselves**
    - Psychologist does not need to judge or interpret the response

## Self-report Measurements

> Ask people to describe themselves

- Use single words, short phrases, or complete sentences
- Demonstrates high **validity** in importance outcomes
    - Conscientiousness => academic performance and job performance
    - Neuroticism => psychopathology
    - Early life rating => happiness/well-being
    - Predict occupational attainment, divorce, and mortality

- Advantage
    1. Self-raters have access to complete information (thoughts, feelings, and motives) that others can't read
    2. The simplest, easiest, and cost-effective
- Disadvantage
    1. Ratings maybe be present in a socially desirable way (especially when the result is important)
    2. Reflect [[Social Self#Self Enhancement bias|self enhancement bias]]
    3. Reference [[Social Self#Social Comparison Theory|group effect]]

## Informant Ratings

> Ask someone who knows a person well to describe

- Use single words, short phrases, or complete sentences (same as self-report, easy to convert)
    - Valuable when self-ratings are impossible to collect or when self report's validity suspect
    - Can be used combined with self-rating to increase **reliability**
    - By itself have similar validity as self-ratings
- Ex. The big 5

- Advantage
    1. Have strong incentives for being accurate
- Disadvantage
    1. Level of relevant info available to the rater (lack full access to subject feelings)
    2. Reference [[Social Self#Social Comparison Theory|group effect]] in similar way as self-rating
    3. Parent's rating are subject to "sibling contrast effect" (exaggerate the true magnitude of differences between children)
    4. Participants often choose likable raters ("letter of recommendation effect") or [[honeymoon effect]]

## Other ways to Classify Objective Tests

- Comprehensiveness (the extent to which how comprehensive the tests are)
    - Focus on single attribute vs. Focusing on too many attributes
- Breadth (broad traits)
    - Ex. Extraversion can be divided into many different interconnected, yet separate traits


# Projective and Implicit Tests

##### Projective Tests
> ------------------------------------------------------------
> Asks a person to interpret ambiguous stimuli (things that an be understood in different ways)
>
> ------------------------------------------------------------

- Based on projective hypothesis
- Assessment based on the belief that important thoughts are outside of the conscious
- Ex. Rorschach Inkblot Test (interpret of ink) & Thematic Test (generate stories about pictures)

- Disadvantage
    1. Requires administer to interpret
    2. Need to develop a *reliable and valid scheme to score the set of responses*
    3. **Validity** are controversial

##### [[Out-Group#Implicit Association Test|Implicit Test]]

- Based on the assumption that people form automatic/implicit **associations** between certain concepts. If such association exist strong associations would means faster connection between concepts
- **Validity** is still in debate, but data are promising (similar to objective measures)


# Behavioral and Performance Measures

- From direct sample of behavior
- Ex. bring participants into conversation, let them watch videotapes, use electronically activated recorder (EAR)

- Advantage
    1. Not subject to response biases
    2. Avoiding the artificiality of other methods (observe in daily lives)
    3. The only method that assert what people *do*, instead of what they *feel*
- Disadvantage
    1. Requires administer to be at scene to observe
    2. Need a rich set of data to have validity and reliability
    3. Sample are often too small to generate the true personality type

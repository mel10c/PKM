# Sigmund Freud

> [[Sigmund Freud]]

- In 1887 opened a private practice to focus on nervous disorders (hysteria) with [[Josef Breuer]]
- *Hysteria*: a board diagnoses typically given to women exhibiting a wide variety of symptoms ^d89518
    - Symptoms included anything that act dis-normal
    - Used to be thought as connected to the reproductive system of women
- Freud argued that **Hysteria can be diagnoses to both man and women**.
- He argue that the cause is [[P&T - Chapter 1#Core Assumption|due]] to **childhood experiences** and **repressed traumatic** memories ★ ^b298ed
    - Most of the childhood trauma argued by Freud is **sexual abuse**
    - His argument is based on the case studies
- Most famous one is `Anno O` (Bertha Pappenheim) with [[Josef Breuer]]
    - Had a variety of symptoms (hallucinations...)
    - First using hypnosis, not working
    - She coined the term "talking theory" (helpful for her to recover)
^ad9fce
- Believes that mind and brain are separate, the mind is the psychological result of what the brain can do
- Created the ==Theory== of [[Psychoanalysis]]
    ![[Psychoanalysis#Psychoanalysis]]


### Assumptions of the Psychoanalytic Approach

1. *Psychic determinism*: Everything happens in mind has a specific cause ([[P&T - Chapter 1#Core Assumption|psychic causality]]) ^8e3b00
2. *Internal Structure*: The 3 parts of the brain ([[#Structure of the mind|ID, EGO, SUPEREGO]])
3. *Psychic conflict*: The [[#Defense Mechanism|conflict]] between the 3 structures of the brain (SUPEREGO vs ID, EGO mediate)
4. *Mental energy*: One have a finite amount of energy that needed [[#Categories of instincts|control]]


### Interpretation of Dreams

- Objects in dreams are **symbols** (may be more personal than universal)
    - Many of the symbols he argued has a sexual meaning
- Dreams has 2 contents
    - Manifest content: what the person remembers
    - **Latent content**: tiled to the symbols of the manifest content
- Other arguments about dreams (by recent research)
    - Dream contains emotions that one cannot process consciously


### Psychosexual Theory

> NOT relevant anymore

- Freud's developmental stages [[P&T - Chapter 1#Psychosexual Stage Model]]
- Issues
    - Children are born with sex drive (at infancy)
    - Children at the "Phallic" stage are attracted to opposite sex parent
    - Controversy around "Penis Envy"
- Useful thoughts
    - The stages helped [[Eric Erikson]] to develop his developmental stages
    - The fixation theory is can be connected to the [[Attachment Theory]]'s anxiety attachments


### Categories of instincts

- **Pleasure principle** (ID) vs. **Reality principle** (EGO)
    - EGO is always trying to find realistic ways to satisfy ID without consequences
- *Libido* - life or sexual instinct (ID)
    - Human seeks instinct gratification (sex pleasure, eating pleasure...)
- *Thanatos* - Death or aggressive instinct
    - People (in WWI) tend to have a desire to relive their sufferings
    - The reason for people to display [[Aggression]] is due to their death drive


### Structure of the mind

- ==Theory==: [[P&T - Chapter 1#Topographic Model]]
    - Unconscious, preconscious, conscious
- ==Theory==: [[P&T - Chapter 1#Structural Model]]
    - ID - actions based on the **pleasure principle** and wish fulfillment
    - EGO - satisfies ID impulses, but takes into consideration the **realities** of the world
    - SUPEREGO - represents **society's values** and standards

### Defense Mechanism

> [[P&T - Chapter 1#Ego and Defenses]]
> Your reflections: [[2022-01-28#PSY230 Reflection]]

- *Repression*: active effort by the EGO to push threatening material out of consciousness
- *Sublimation*: channelling threatening unconscious impulses into socially acceptable actions (healthy)
- *Displacement*: channelling impulses to nonthreatening objects [[Frustration–aggression hypothesis]]
- *Denial*: refusal to accept that certain fact exist (consciously known)
- *Reaction formation*: acting in a manner opposite to threatening unconscious desires
- *Intellectualization*: removal of emotional content from the thought, helps bring difficult thoughts into consciousness without anxiety
    - Focus deep into dealing with the problem, block emotion
- *Projection*: attributing unconscious impulse to other people


# Carl Jung

> [[Carl Jung]]

##### Archetypes
> ------------------------------------------------------------
> Images in the **Collective Unconscious** that prepare people to respond to the world
>
> ------------------------------------------------------------

- Ex. family (mother, father), story (wise old men, witch, hero)
- Archetypes are "...Not an idea, but a collective mode of functioning" (**pattern of behavior/instincts**)
- Connected to [[Cultural Psychology]], where all of the archetypes are available when one is born, but chose which one to act on depends on the [[culture]]


### Conceptualize the Self

> Keeps EGO, no ID or SUPEREGO
> Jung's ==Theory== of the self

- *Jung's EGO*: field of consciousness, command centre of self, **connects inner and outer worlds** ^5316a8
    - Similar to [[Eric Erikson]]
- Jung's unconscious:
    - *Personal unconscious*: unconscious material of the individual
    - *Collective unconscious*: unconscious material common to all human beings
- *Anima*: feminine side of the male; OR *Animus*: masculine side of the female
    - One projects their anima and animus when finding opposite sex
- *Persona*: the part of oneself that gets **presented** to the world
- *Shadow*: **negative** side of personality (also projects to other people)
    - Need to bring to conscious awareness to resolve them

## Personality Theory

> Jung's ==Theory== of personality

- Attitudes (first one to coin introvert vs extrovert)
    - *Introvert*: inward turning
    - *Extrovert*: outward turning
- Basic functions of consciousness
    - *Sensation*: perception by means of physical sense organs (observations)
    - *Intuition*: perception by way of the unconscious (instincts)
    - *Thinking*: process of cognitive thought (rationality)
    - *Feeling*: function of subjective judgement or valuation (emotion)

### The Myers-Briggs Personality Test

> Developed by Katharine Cook Brigs and her daughter Isabel Briggs Myers

> Inspired by Jung's theory of personality
> Added Judging-Perceiving: how one implement the information they have processed

> | 16           | Personalities |
> |--------------|---------------|
> | Extroversion | Introversion  |
> | Sensing      | Intuition     |
> | Thinking     | Feeling       |
> | Judging      | Perceiving    |

- Heavily critiqued for the lack of proper research to determine **validity and reliability**
    - Poor test-retest reliability
    - Poor predictive validity
    - No sound measure for detecting social response biases
- Connection to [[Big-Five Model]]
    - I/E => low/high in Extroversion
    - S/N => low/high on Openness
    - T/F => low/high on Agreeableness
    - P/J => low/high on Conscientiousness
    - Turbulent/Assertive => low/high on Neuroticism

# Viktor Frankl

> [[Viktor Frankl]]

### Existentialism

> [[Existential Psychology]]

- Willing to meaning: **thought work, love, and suffering**
- *Existential vacuum*: manifest in a state of **boredom**.
- Boredom creating more problems than distress
    - Boredom makes people strive for [[Sigmund Freud]]'s pleasure principle
    - Lack a sense of meaning for day to day lives
- Related to [[Søren Kierkegaard]]'s argument that mankind is doomed between boredom and distressed
- Frankl argues that boredom is the major issue that people is dealing with right now (no meaning)
- *Logo therapy*: striving to find meaning in life is the most powering motivation force

### Power of Free Will

- Did not agree with Freud's deterministic believe
- Thinks that one **needs to believe** that they are in control, and changes can be made


# Erik Erikson

> [[Eric Erikson]]

- Emphasized the **important role of the EGO**
    - Function of the EGO is to establish and maintain a sense of identity
    - Similar to [[Carl Jung]]'s definition of [[#^5316a8|EGO]]

### Theory of Development

> Erikson's ==Theory== of development

> | Age                   | Success/Crisis              | Connection                      |
> |-----------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|
> | Infancy               | Trust vs. Mistrust          | [[Attachment Theory]]           |
> | Toddler               | Autonomy vs. Shame & Doubt  | [[Sigmund Freud]]'s annal stage |
> | Early Childhood       | Initiatives vs. Guilt       |                                 |
> | Elementary School Age | Industry vs. Inferiority    |                                 |
> | Adolescence           | Identity vs. Role Confusion |                                 |
> | Young Adulthood       | Intimacy vs. Isolation      |                                 |
> | Adulthood             | Generatively vs. Stagnation |                                 |
> | Old Age               | EGO Integrity vs. Despair   |                                 |

- Developed a theory of development over the **entire lifespan**
- People encounter crisis at various points in their lives
- Lack of primary research, but reliable

### Neurotic People

- Coined the term "Neurotic"
- *Neurotic*: people who are trapped on a self-defeating interpersonal style
- Argues that its developed due to **childhood experiences**
- Avoid anxiety provoking experiences
    - Moving toward people (interdependent on other people) [[Attachment Theory#Anxious Attachment]]
    - Moving against people (manipulate, control other people)
    - Moving away from people (autonomy) [[Attachment Theory#Avoidant Attachment]]

### Feminine Psychology

- Introduced the concept of *womb envy* (in response to penis envy)
    - Men are jealous that women can create life, so they put their creativity in work to fulfill this envy
    - Both men and women had desirable traits, none is better than others
- Drew attention to **sociocultural factors** in explaining **gender differences**
    - Argues that cultural is very important an determining how men and women see themselves
    - Social rolls of gender differences

# Dreams

- ==Theory==: Activation-Synthesis Hypothesis
	- Dream do **not mean anything**
	- Random activation/impulses in the brain, memories, emotions that comes up without meaning

- ==Theory==: Information Processing Theories
	- Dreams help us transfer what we experienced into the day **into our memory**
	- Helps people to **organize experiences** thought he day

- ==Theory==: Throat Simulation Theory
	- Dreams provided an **evolutionary advantage** as they allow us to simulate threats and enhance mechanisms for threat perception and avoidance
	- Helps people to deal with awkward moments
	- Experience unprepared events to help avoid it happening in the real world

## Research Evidence on Dream

- "Vivid and emotional intense dreams are linked to part of the amygdala and hippocampus"
    - Suggest that **dream does deal with emotions and memories**
- "REM sleep influences our ability to understand complex emotions in daily life"
    - Dream may play some role in helping recognizing positive emotions and deal with negative ones
- "People are more likely to remember their dreams if woken directly after REM sleep. Brain activity related to memory retrieval when awake is comparable to the brain activity in those that remembered their dream"
    - Dreaming may **use the same neurotic pathways with memory retrieval**

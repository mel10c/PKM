# Descriptive Models

### Gordon Allport

> [[Gordon Allport]]: father of trait approach

- *Lexical Approach*: all important personality characteristics should be reflected in the language that human use to describe other people
    - [[P&T - Chapter 3.1#Lexical Hypothesis]]
- *Nomothetic Approach*: people can be described along a single dimension according to their **level** of particular trait
    - Most modern assessment approach. Ex. Big-Five
    - Focus on **research**, not on specific individual
- *Idiographic Approach*: identifies the combination of traits that bes **accounts** for the personality of individual
    - Ex. MBTI
    - Focus on **individual**
- *Cardinal Traits*: dominate a person's personality; connected to [[Carl Jung#Archetypes|persona]]
- *Central Traits*: traits that best **describe** a person (limited amount)
- *Secondary Traits*: less relevant traits, only present in certain **situations**

### Factor Analysis

- By Raymond Cattell
- Was used to determine structure of human personality
- *Factor Analysis*: does score on particular item tend to **group together**
- Found large groups of traits could reduced down to 16 core personality traits


## The 5 Factor Model

![[P&T - Chapter 3.1#Five-Factor Model]]

- Connected to the temperament [[Developmental Perspective#Dimensions|dimensions]]
- `Openness`: (+) - forgive people; (-) - substance abuse (get bored)
- `Conscienceless`: (+) - stable job
- `Extraversion`: (+) - higher satisfaction in intimate relationship
- `Agreeableness`
- `Neuroticism` : (-) -  mental health issue
- The result is a **percentile score**, compared to average results of population
    - Assume [[Continuous Random Variable#Normal Distribution|normal distribution]]
    - Middle `=>` variability of trait depending on situation
    - Extreme `=>` consistent across situation

### HEXACO Model

- [[P&T - Chapter 3.1#Other Model]]
- `Honesty/humility` as the 6th factor
- High: honest, humble, not interesting in wealth, not manipulative
- Low: dishonest, strong sense of self, motivated material, manipulative

## Dark Triad

> Reflection: [[2022-02-06#PSY230 Packback Discussion]]

- *Machiavellianism*: manipulation, self-interest, disregard for others
- *Narcissism*: grandiosity, egotism, entitlement
- *Psychopathy*: remorselessness, impulsively, lack of empathy
- Not personality disorder, but over the level, can become clinical
    - Narcissism -> narcissism clinical disorder
    - Psychopathy -> antisocial disorder
- Lack empathy, even though with similar level of cognitive empathy
    - Understand, but cannot feel it
- Connection to Big-Five
    - Low in `Agreeableness`
    - Psychopathy is related to low `Neuroticism` (no negative emotion)



## Health and Social Influence

Type A&B Personality

- *Type A*: have a higher **competitive** achievement striving.
    - Respond to frustrating situations with **anger**
    - Tend to dominate a group discussion
    - <u>Health</u>: correlated with **cardio-vascular disease**

### Optimism & Pessimism

- *Dispositional optimism*: extend to which people adopt to positive viewpoints
    - <u>Health</u>: helps coping, well-being
- *Active strategies* for coping
    - **Healthy strategies**
    - Problem solving, cognitive restructuring ([[Viktor Frankl]]'s attitude of suffering), express emotions, social support
- *Avoidance strategies*
    - Less healthy strategy
    - Problem avoidance, wishful thinking, self-criticism, social withdraw

### Physiological Stress Response

- *Acute stress*: short term stress (traffic jam)
- *Chronic stress*: long term stress (abuse relationship)
- People all experience stress, the important thing is how to **recover from stress**
- *Allostasis*: how the body respond to stressors to maintain homeostasis
    - Advantage for optimistic people

##### Biopsychosocial Model of Stress

^3bd136

> ------------------------------------------------------------
> Tend to perceive things as **challenge or a threat** (in goal-orientated task)
>
> ------------------------------------------------------------
- *Treat response*: a pattern of cardiovascular stress response exhibited when one perceives they cannot handle the demands of a situation
- <u>Character</u>: increase strength of heart contraction, increased heart rate, decreased blood output, constriction of cardiovascular vessels
- [[Group and Culture#Zajonc's Model social facilitation ★]]


### Social Anxiety

- *Social Anxiety*: extreme anxiety surrounding social interactions
    - Increased Physiological arousal
    - Inability to concentrate
    - Feelings of nervousness
- No direct association with `Introversion`
- Can be explained in part of high evaluation apprehension
    - [[Group and Culture#Other aspect of social facilitation]]


# Social Cognitive Model

> [[Walter Mischel]]

![[P&T - Chapter 3.1#Social-cognitive Process]]

### Key Factors

- *Encoding*: categories of encoding information about one's self, other, events, and situation
    - Learnt from [[Group and Culture]]
- *Expectations and Beliefs*: expectations for what will happen in certain situations
    - For outcomes of behaviors, and for one's personal efficacy, in [[Self Schema]]
- *Affects*: feelings, emotions, and emotional responses
    - Emotions somewhat shapes part of the personality
- *Goals and Values*: individual goal, value, and life pro
    - [[Values]]
- *Competencies and Self-Regulatory Plans*: perceived abilities, plans, and strategies
    - Related to `Conscienceless`
    - The **goal** of the `Marshmallow Study`
- Consistency of personality is due to identification of **situation-behavior** relationship that become behavior signature of personality
    - High consistency within situation
    - Inconsistency with variability depending on situation

## Consistency of Traits

- Personality have both a **biological/genetic and environmental basis**
    - Extraversion variability explained by genetic
- Big Five traits and relation to brain regions

## Situational Variability

- By Kurt Lewin (father of social psychology)
- Argues that behavior is a function of a person and their environment
    - $B = f(P, E)$
- [[Unique]]: book's argument
- Little evidence for cross-situational consistency
- [[P&T - Chapter 3.2#Corresponsive Principle]]

# Whole-Trait Theory

> [[Whole Trait Theory]] Fleeson, Jayawickreme

- 2 distinct parts of personality: Descriptive and Explanatory aspects of traits
- *Descriptive* parts: density distribution ([[Big-Five Model]])
    - Measure variation of the trait (stability)
- *Explanatory* parts: social-cognitive mechanism ([[#Social Cognitive Model]])
    - Explain cause of variation
- Measurement (descriptive)
    - Parameter: location on dimension; width captures variability within an individual behavior
    - Shape: normal or skewed
```text
Input ==> Intermediates ==> Output
```
- Input: environmental event & internal event
- Intermediates: activation of goals, initiation of homeostatic forces
- Output: change in manifestation of the traits
`Study`: Emotional and its relationship to [[Big-Five Model]]
- Methods:
    - Ecological momentary assessment
    - Asked about state personality, what they were doing, and their affect
    - Looked at within and between person variation
- Result
    - `Openness`: positive mood -> high
    - `Conscienceless`: positive mood -> little higher
    - `Extraversion`: positive mood -> high
    - `Agreeableness`: positive mood -> high
    - `Neuroticism`: positive mood -> low ★

# Change in Personality

> [[The Personality Myth]]

- [[P&T - Chapter 3.2#Maturity Principle]]
    - Personality get more stable with age
    - [[Eric Erikson#Theory of Development]] enter different development stage
- Single **behavior change** would result change in personality trait

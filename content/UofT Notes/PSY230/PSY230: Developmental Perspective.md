# Early Development

> The earliest people we see in our lives shape what we are

- Builds expectations for future relationship
    - Teach human what to expect and how to handle relationships in life

## Objective Relation Theory

> ==Theory==: Psychodynamic - [[P&T - Chapter 1#Object Relations Theory]]

- Elements of satisfaction and fractions exist in all relationship
    - See the complicated part of caregivers
    - Lead to contradictory feelings in relationships
    - Can lead to feelings of **love and hate**
- Need to **distinguish between parts** of a love object and the whole person
    - Healthy development requires **integrating the good and the bad** parts of the object - in particular other people
- People have *internal representation* of the other people (the "parts" that either good or bad)
    - Stored in the unconscious part of one's self
    - **Unconsciously influence** an individual and predicts their behavior in later adulthood

## Attachment Theory

> ==Theory==: [[Attachment Theory]]

- Infants has a strong desire to **avoid separation** from and **get reunited** with primary caregiver
- The ability for an individual to form **emotional attachment** to other person gives then **sense of security**
- Adult **romantic relationships** function like caregiver-child attachment relationships
    - prefer proximity, with distress upon separation
    - Turn to partner for support in danger
    - Derive security from partner, enable exploration and engagement with rest of the world
^340db5
- First developed by [[John Bowlby]]: Shown in other species, thus, its a evolutional advantage
- Examined further by [[Mary Ainsworth]] -- `study`: [[Strange Situation]]: Provides "secure base" for exploration

### Attachment Types

##### Avoidant/Dismissing Attachment

- Caregiver is **not responsive** to child's needs
- Child loose interest in relationships
- Low desire or fear of having close relationships

##### Anxious/Preoccupied Attachment

- Caregiver is **inconsistent** to child's needs
- Child become overly needing other's attention
- Having extreme desire to be close to people

##### Secure Attachment

- Caregiver respond to child's needs **appropriately**
- Child develop healthy relationships
- Okay with close relationships but also can accept separation

##### Fearful/Disorganized Attachment

- Caregiver is **frightening or frightened** (abusive or been abused)
- Child is constantly anxious and don't know what to expect from relationship
- Needing close relationship (anxious) but when feeling of losing, start to push away (avoidant)

### Recent Classification

- Focus on dimensional measuring rather than simply classification
- Attachment style can change
- Research in done in Western middle class participants
    - Careful on assumption that it applies universally
    - Has moral issues with it (parenting types)

### Insecure Attachment

- Can lead to **ambivalence** in relationships (based on satisfaction)
- Impact of **attention** to threat and reward in relationship
- Low positive regard => negative commitment; needy dependence => positive commitment

`Study`
- <u>Method</u>
    - Recruited participation in romantic relationship
    - Measured attachment style
    - Measured perceptions of **social threat and reward**
- <u>Result</u>
    - **Anxious** attachment increase ambivalence because **increased perception of threat**
    - **Avoidant** attachment increase ambivalence because **decreased perception of rewards**

# Temperament

- **Stable** overtime
- Individual differences of how people respond to the world (nature and nurture)
- Related to [[Personality Assessments#Personality|personality]], based people treat child differently from their temperament
- Biologically based, independent of experiences, stable
- Connected to *parental style*

### Parenting Style

### Dimensions
- `Emotionality`/negative affectively
- `Activity`
- `Sociability`/Extraversion
- `Shyness` (not = introversion)

# Parental Alienation

> Understand the difference from *family abuse* from *alienation*
> Not all child fall for it

- When divorce parents get along, spend similar amount of time with child, child can adapt well
- *Parental Alienation* - one parent intentionally (or unintentionally) engages in behaviours that lead a child to **reject the other parent**
    - A form of **child abuse** and **intimate partner violence**
    - Occurs in the context of separation or divorce
    - Manifest in hostility, anger, and/or fear toward other parent

<u>Parent Behaviors</u>
- Show anger, hostility, violence, fear to child when other parent visit
- Make the child feel guilty when/after other visit
    - Can cause the parental-child relationship to reverse (child feel responsible for parent)
- Tell child exaggerated/fake info about the other parent

<u>Child Behaviours</u>
- Can range mild to severe
- Manifest in hostility, anger, and/or fear toward the other parent

<u>Reasons</u>
- Use the child to make the other partner hurt
    - Due to jealous, anger, or fear
- Wanted fully control of the children
    - Can't except that child wanted to be with other parent


### 8 Signs

1. Denigration(诽谤)
    - Involves *cognitive splitting*: all bad toward rejected parent; all good about other parent
    - Does not happen in child/family abuse; child still can tell good memories after abuse
2. Lack of ambivalence
    - Completely trust the "good" parent
3. Independent thinker phenomenon
    - Child takes responsibility; defend the alienated parent
4. Frivolous or absurd rationalization
    - Rationalize the rejection of the rejected parent
    - Believe the exaggerated facts about rejected parent
5. Automatic support for alienating parent
    - Always jump to alienated parent's defense
6. Absence of guilt
    - Child don't feel bad toward rejected parent
    - Want the rejected parent to go away to defend themself
7. Borrowed scenarios
    - False memories/facts about rejected parent; mirror what the alienated parent is saying
    - These stories usually lack substance or detail
8. Spread of animosity
    - The negative emotions extend to the rejected parent's external family

## Cognitive Splitting

> A defense mechanism
> Can be found in some mental disorder (ex. Borderline)

- *Cognitive Splitting*: failure to bring both the positive and negative parts of a object together into a whole; leads to all or nothing thinking
- Connect to [[#Objective Relation Theory]]
    - Due to psychological manipulation, they feel unsecure, so only except good sides of alienated parent to make them feel safe
    - Avoid the conflict necessary to be with other parent
- The child come to see one parent (alienated parent) as **all good** and the other parent (rejected parent) as **all bad**
- **Ego defense mechanism**: children do this to protect themselves against the loyalty conflict they are force in

## Treatment

- Parent with this behavior is often associated with personality disorders
- Need to resolve the cognitive splitting
- Ideally, remove the child from the alienating parent while treatment is ongoing
- Critical thinking- get the child to recognize what has been happening to them
- Controversial topic
    - False claims with child abuse make court different to recognize
    - False claims about alienation can lead child to be with abusive parent

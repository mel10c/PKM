Hey, I'm Melaney! I'm a cognitive sciennce study at UofT. Welcome to my cozy cornder on the web for my ideas, photogrpahy, programs, and anything else I want to show. 

This side is free from ads, affiliate links, tracking or analytics. It stands as a playground for me to share my thoughts, build on what I've learned with the world. Although, this is my personal blog site, it would be my best interest to make the internet a more inclusive place, even if it's only for a small corner. I hope I can inspire others to craft their own creative corners as well.

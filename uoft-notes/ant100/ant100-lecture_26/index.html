   What is Heritage?  “Heritage is a property – something that is passed down from previous generations. Cultural heritage consists of the cultures, values, and traditions of a particular community, group, or nation. Cultural heritage can be comprised of tangible things such as artifacts, artwork, and buildings, or intangible things, such as language, dances, and stories."><title>ANT100: Lecture_26</title><meta name=viewport content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1"><link rel="shortcut icon" type=image/png href=https://mel10c.github.io/mel.zhu//icon.png><link href=https://mel10c.github.io/mel.zhu/styles.9a8661985b360a1d97e0e538e164abef.min.css rel=stylesheet><link href=https://mel10c.github.io/mel.zhu/styles/_light_syntax.86a48a52faebeaaf42158b72922b1c90.min.css rel=stylesheet id=theme-link><script src=https://mel10c.github.io/mel.zhu/js/darkmode.905e4d2da56a9111aff695a0a4b69900.min.js></script>

Who owns the past? Who gets to decide what gets excavated and what doesn’t? Who determined site interpretation? Who “owns” artifacts? In Canada, artifacts are held “in trust” for Canadians (by provincial repositories; different in Ontario)</li></ul><a href=#indigenous-critiques-of-archaeology><h3 id=indigenous-critiques-of-archaeology><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Indigenous Critiques of Archaeology:</h3></a><ul><li>Vine Deloria “Anthropologists and Other Friends” (Custer died for your sins);

<strong>repatriation</strong> of human remains, funerary and sacred objects (not all, but those deemed significant) Canada: province-by-province basis; each institution has its own policies on repatriation</li><li>The Ancient One (Kennewick Man): ca. 8500 years old; Kennewick, Washington; discovered by two men in 1996, eroding along a riverbank; initially believed to be remains of a European settler, based on skull morphology; part of a cascade point discovered embedded in the man’s hip; point dated 8500 years ago; claim that Kennewick Man was not related to modern Indigenous peoples, contrary to their claims; genetic analysis confirmed that the remains were indeed related to the Indigenous groups</li></ul><blockquote><p>Canadian Example: Rainey River Mounds Repatriation: repatriation of human remains and artifacts excavated in 1950s and 1960s near Rainey River; artifacts now at museums owned by descendant communities</p></blockquote><ul><li><u>Indigenous Archaeologies</u>: shift in power away from researchers and towards descendant communities; draws on multi lines of evidence and centres non-archaeological ways of knowing (i.e., Indigenous ways of knowing); it requires rigorous methods, analyses, and interpretations, just like good scholarship anywhere; “two-eyed seeing”; “braided knowledge”</li><li>Archaeology in the cause of <strong><u>Nationalism</u></strong>: beginnings of archaeology as discipline during the rise of Nation States in late 19th century; ancient past became central to new identity; example: Germany (post-WWI); 1920s, ethnic regions of Europe identified by archaeological remains: German ancestry rooted in prehistory of Central Europe</li><li><u>Ahnenerbe</u>: research organization established by Himmler; sees itself as the centre of European civilization; name means “inherited from the forefathers”; National Socialist regime: Germany 1933-1945</li><li><u>Externsteine</u>: natural sandstone formation; 12th century Benedictine monks carved rooms into the stone; Ahnenerbe excavation to find “Germanic temple”; interpreted as place of worship for cult of the sun; cited as an example of Germany’s glorious past</li><li><em>Thingstätten</em>: established in places where “significant Germanic occupation” demonstrated through archaeology; intended to show German cultural continuity through time</li><li>Dolni Vestonice: Silvia Tomaskova; Moravia: was a German-speaking area during Austro-Hungarian Empire and Czechoslovakia; two kilns; 2300 clay figurines; clay pellets and slabs; bird bone flutes; 25 000 years old</li><li>Dolni Vestonice: putting Czechoslovakia on the map: Karel Absolon, 1924: large-scale horizontal excavation; compared with Pompeii, King Tut’s tomb; Czechoslovakia and Moravia in the study of human origins; new nation with rich archaeological history like other European nations; massive mammoth hunting site and settlement (houses built of mammoth bone); concluded that all Northern peoples must have originated from northern peoples in Czechoslovakia</li><li>Dolni Vestonice becomes Unterwisternitz: 1939: Ahnenerbe takes over excavations; Bohmers: to “correct” earlier work; wanted to trace “Nordic” (German) past to the Paleolithic; focus on art objects to understand worldview of peoples who “conquered” Europe and vanquished Neanderthals; site becomes an Indo-German village</li><li>Great Zimbabwe: urban centre ca. 1000-1500 AD; Cecil Rhodes finances excavation to “prove” Great Zimbabwe could not have been built by Africans (must have been foreigners); official interpretation until 1979</li><li>International trade in artifacts and repatriation: the Elgin Marbles; one of many examples where artifacts were acquired, with conflict between the involved parties</li><li>The bust of Nefertiti: excavated in Egypt, taken to museum in Germany; Egypt wants it returned, Germany refuses</li><li>History of Looting: tombs of Pharaohs moved to Valley of the Kings to protect them from looting, which wasa big problem even back then; King Tut’s tomb was very significant due to lack of looting</li><li>International Conventions: the 1954 Hague Convention on Preserving Cultural Heritage; the 1970 UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export, and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property; will not loot sites during warfare, and will not allow looted material to enter/leave their borders</li><li>Archaeology and Mesopotamia: Mesopotamia viewed as the cradle of Western civilization; modern states have drawn on this history to promote narratives; excavations of Ur attracted many people, including Agatha Christie; Syrian and Iraqi leaders took control of archaeological sites after independence; ancient history became part of modern states’ identity; one of Saddam Hussein’s palaces built in the style of a ziggurat, and overlooks Babylonian ruins</li><li>Looting, Destruction, and ISIS: performance (for attention); to anger “the West”; emphasizes the overthrowing of old political order of Nation States; destroying “idols” of nationalism (Christopher Jones, 2018)Looted Artifacts and Insurgences: ISIS known to sell looted artifacts; estimated to have made between $4 million – 7 billion this way</li></ul></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li>No backlinks found</li></ul></div><div><script async src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://mel10c.github.io/mel.zhu/js/graph.2d9e48dbe7ea47c0ef1c58296ce14448.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by Melaney Zhu using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, © 2023</p><ul><li><a href=https://mel10c.github.io/mel.zhu/>Home</a></li><li><a href=https://www.instagram.com/melaney_dxl/>Instagram</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/mel10c>GitHub</a></li><li><a href=https://linkedin.com/in/melzyy>LinkedIn</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/mel10c/mel.zhu/blob/hugo/content/documents/Resume.pdf>Resume</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>

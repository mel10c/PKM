The Urban Revolution  Close relationship between city and the state, according to Childe 10 criteria for early states; size and large population; full-time specialists; agricultural surplus; monumental architecture; long-distance trade; writing; ruling elites and class-based; taxation; control of labour; some traits present in non-cities, and some cities don’t have these traits  Chris Gosden and Aggregation: urbanism as a process; part of aggregation: linked to power (sacred and secular); not necessarily social inequality; competing lineages; example of Talianky, a Neolithic aggregation site on the Russian Steppe   Catalhoyuk: 9100 to 7700 years ago; in central Turkey; farmers, but also rely on hunting animals; like Abu Hereyra and Natufian, people practice sub-floor burial; no indication of social inequality; households are the centre of production  Urbanism in Mesopotamia:  Tigris and Euphrates rivers (modern-day Iraq); first sites agreed to be cities; structures built out of reeds and mud; fertile soils allowed for large-scale agriculture; process of urbanization begins ca."><title>ANT100: Lecture_25</title><meta name=viewport content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1"><link rel="shortcut icon" type=image/png href=https://mel10c.github.io/mel.zhu//icon.png><link href=https://mel10c.github.io/mel.zhu/styles.9a8661985b360a1d97e0e538e164abef.min.css rel=stylesheet><link href=https://mel10c.github.io/mel.zhu/styles/_light_syntax.86a48a52faebeaaf42158b72922b1c90.min.css rel=stylesheet id=theme-link><script src=https://mel10c.github.io/mel.zhu/js/darkmode.905e4d2da56a9111aff695a0a4b69900.min.js></script>

Uruk: the first city; 20 000 – 40 000 people (very densely populated); authority over smaller cities and towns in region; temples become massive land-holding establishments; palace (<em>Ensi</em>); city council (selected a new king when needed</li><li><em>Cuneiform</em>: earliest form of writing; possibly invented in Uruk itself; could be used to write several different languages; since characters represented syllables; mostly used for administrative purposes</li><li><u>Hammurabi’s Code</u> (3800 years ago): first written law code in the world; talks about perjury, robbery, marriage, adoption, ownership of slaves, costs for hiring an ox, etc.; shows authority of Mesopotamian kings</li><li><u>Epic of Gilgamesh</u>: <strong>one of the first, if not the first, works of literature</strong>;

stone seals rolled across mud/clay; become very elaborate over time; display stories/myths/historical events</li><li><u>Ruling Class</u>: pronounced social inequality in Mesopotamia; large tombs in the cemetery at Ur</li></ul><a href=#urbanizationruralization><h3 id=urbanizationruralization><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Urbanization/Ruralization</h3></a><ul><li>Around 80% of the population of Mesopotamia lived in cities</li><li>Indus Valley (Harappan) Civilization (2600 – 1900 BC): near Pakistan-India border; sites from Iran to Delhi; much larger area than Egypt or Mesopotamia; 5 large Indus Valley cities, 2/3 to be discussed in lecture</li><li><u>Melluhan</u>: sea trade between Mesopotamia and the Indus Valley, documented as old as 5000 years ago; Mesopotamian texts refer to Melluhan (Indus Valley civilization) as an important trade partner</li><li>Mohenjo Daro: 4000 – 5000 years old (starts to emerge as a major urban centre ca. 4500 years ago); largest city of the Indus; series of neighbourhoods/compounds (each neighbourhood was walled; some suggestion that each was founded at slightly different times); acropolis/citadel (westernmost mound; may have been used for public gatherings, may be some sort of wealthy lineage associated with it); 2 and 3 storey buildings; constructed public wells and toilets; both inside and outside houses; particular emphasis on trade and production of goods; elites appear to gain prestige/wealth because of their role as merchants</li><li>Indus cities: very elaborate drainage system; thousands of years before Rome</li><li>Chert Weights: cubical weights in gradual sizes; show up in all settlements; largest weight is 100x the weight of the smallest; may have been used for controlling trade, or collecting taxes</li><li>Mohenjo Daro: The Great Bath: some of the earliest water tanks in the ancient world</li><li>Harappa and Mohenjo Daro: granaries: no evidence for storage of agricultural surplus; believed to be a large public building, of unknown purpose</li><li>Indus Valley Rulers: no evidence for monuments to elite power; no depictions of warfare; few graveyards, and graves do not contain many goods; elites distinguished through where they live, and through seals; writing system not known; appear to have access to materials to make ornaments; such as shells or beads; compounds: competing families;

Erlitou seems to be the biggest of the city-states that emerged; seems to be on top of the hierarchy; acts almost like a capital; bronze-making plays a large role; site of Erlitou includes large palace complex at its core; evidence of craft production; not many people living in these cities; evidence for increasing warfare, increased trade, regional/shared ideology, and movement of people</li><li>Shang China: capital at Anyang; territorial state; city itself still not densely populated</li><li>Oracle Bones, writing, and bronzes; oracle bones wound up on the antiquities market, were traced back to a deposit; some of the earliest Chinese texts; used to communicate with ancestors; controlled by kings and elites</li><li>Shang Tombs: royal tombs at Anyang; only one such tomb found unlooted; contained many artifacts, as well as human sacrifices</li><li>Indian Ocean as conduit for people and things: sea connections between the civilizations mentioned above</li></ul><a href=#great-zimbabwe><h3 id=great-zimbabwe><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Great Zimbabwe</h3></a><ul><li>Sub-Saharan African state;

no evidence for elaborate burials, or writing system; may have held between 10 000 – 20 000 people; Shadrek Chirikure and Innocent Pikiyari: enclosures are houses of successive rulers; Shona political succession; succession alternates among ruling houses; each ruler rules from own house; apartheid-like system in colonial Zimbabwe; colonial rulers believed Great Zimbabwe was built by peoples from the Middle East; this was supported using propaganda; several soapstone figures found, including one of a bird, which now appears on Zimbabwe’s flag</li></ul><a href=#urbanism-in-west-africa><h3 id=urbanism-in-west-africa><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Urbanism in West Africa</h3></a><ul><li>Bassey Andah (late 20th century); studied farming and urbanism in West Africa; critical of colonial context of archaeology in Africa; archaeology as a means of developing African consciousness; argued that towns followed a distinct African trajectory; earliest towns were local developments, and showed little evidence for social inequality, despite being densely populated</li><li><u>West African Urbanism:</u> Yoruba; Benin city; Ghana; possible emerging settlement hierarchy; process of urbanization may have begun around 3000 years ago, with the above cities emerging by the 10th century</li></ul><a href=#urbanism-in-the-americas><h3 id=urbanism-in-the-americas><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Urbanism in the Americas:</h3></a><ul><li>Caral: modern-day Peru, about 6200 years old, evidence for maize domestication;

How was it implemented (i.e., what was the sample and method)?<ul><li>The intervention was implemented through a <strong>randomized controlled trial</strong>. The study sample consisted of 1,175 Iraqi Christians who were displaced by ISIS and currently living in displacement camps in Erbil, Iraq.</li><li>The participants were randomly assigned to <strong>one of two soccer teams</strong>: an all-Christian team or a team mixed with Muslims. The teams <strong>played each other in a tournament</strong>, and the researchers measured changes in intergroup attitudes and behaviors before and after the tournament</li><li>Result found that intergroup contact through soccer led to increased positive attitudes and social cohesion between Christians and Muslims</li></ul></li><li>How did the researcher operationalize intergroup social cohesion? Do you think behavioral and attitudinal outcome scales measured what they purported to measure<ul><li>They operationalized intergroup social cohesion in her study by using the contact hypothesis</li><li>The behavioral outcomes measured in the study included attending mixed dinner events and a joint cultural event, while the attitudinal outcomes measured were perceived discrimination, anxiety towards outgroup members, and in-group bias. The scales used to measure these outcomes were adapted from previous studies and were found to have adequate reliability and validity. However, it is important to note that these scales are not perfect measures of intergroup social cohesion, as they may not capture all aspects of this complex construct.</li><li>Overall, while the behavioral and attitudinal outcome scales used in the study m<strong>ay not have captured all aspects of intergroup social cohesion</strong>, they did measure relevant constructs and were found to have <strong>adequate psychometric properties</strong>.</li></ul></li><li>What did the study find? On which DVs did the intervention produce changes? On which did it not produce changes?<ul><li>The study found that intergroup contact through soccer had a <strong>positive impact on social cohesion between Christians and Muslims</strong> in post-ISIS Iraq.</li><li>The intervention resulted in <strong>improved behaviors towards Muslim peers</strong> among Christians, such as expressing less prejudice, more positive attitudes, and greater willingness to interact with Muslims.</li><li>The intervention <strong>did not, however, substantially affect behaviors in other social contexts,</strong> such as patronizing a restaurant in Muslim-dominated Mosul or attending a mixed social event</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>[@2019SUE-DisarmingRacialMicroaggressions] ^ae9b5b<ul><li>What are microaggressions? What are macroaggressions? What is the difference between them? How do they affect people of colour, according to the authors?<ul><li><em>Microaggressions</em> as &ldquo;the <strong>everyday</strong> slights, insults, putdowns, invalidations, and <strong>offensive behaviors that people of color experience in daily interactions</strong> with generally well-intentioned White Americans who may be unaware that they have engaged in racially demeaning ways toward target groups&rdquo;</li><li>Macroaggressions, on the other hand, are <strong>&ldquo;overt and intentional acts of discrimination&rdquo;</strong></li><li>Microaggressions can have a significant impact on the mental health and well-being of people of color. These experiences can lead to feelings of anger, frustration, confusion, and helplessness, as well as contribute to anxiety and depression. Moreover, the authors argue that the cumulative effect of microaggressions over time can lead to a sense of alienation and disconnection from mainstream society, which can have a negative impact on the overall quality of life of people of color</li></ul></li><li>Who are targets, allies, and bystanders, according to the authors?<ul><li>The <em>targets</em> refer to individuals <strong>who experience microaggressions</strong> and are the focus of the microintervention strategies.</li><li>White <em>allies</em> are people who identify as <strong>white and are committed to fighting against racism and promoting equality</strong>. They can use their privilege to disrupt and challenge the microaggressions directed towards targets.</li><li><em>Bystanders</em> are individuals who <strong>witness microaggressions but are not the target of such aggression</strong>. Bystanders can intervene in a variety of ways, including speaking up, providing support to the target, or seeking assistance from others to address the situation</li></ul></li><li>What are the four broad types of strategies for addressing microinterventions that the authors identify? What are examples of each kind of microintervention that could be directed toward perpetrator microaggressions, institutional macroaggressions, and societal macroaggressions?<ul><li><img src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mel10c/image/main/obsidian/20230330172147.png> ^201c59</li></ul></li><li>What aspects of this research do you think could apply to other groups (i.e., those defined by something other than race) or other cultural contexts? Why or why not? [note that there is no one right answer to this question, rather it’s a prompt for you to critically consider how you think this work may or may not apply to other contexts]<ul><li>While the article focuses on race-related bias, it is possible that the concepts and strategies presented could be applied to other forms of bias, such as those related to gender, sexuality, ability, or religion. However, it is important to note that each group&rsquo;s experiences of bias may differ and require unique strategies for intervention and prevention. Additionally, the cultural context in which the bias occurs is also important to consider, as cultural values and norms may affect how bias is perceived and addressed. Therefore, while the framework presented in this article may be a useful starting point for addressing bias in other contexts, it would need to be adapted and tailored to specific groups and cultural contexts.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>[@2022OKONOFUA-SideliningBiasSituationist] ^47c469<ul><li>How do the authors conceptualize the self? What are working selves?<ul><li>The authors conceptualize the <em>self</em> as <strong>consisting of multiple working selves</strong>.</li><li><strong>Each working self is a different aspect of a person&rsquo;s identity that can be activated in different situations</strong> and contexts, and can influence behavior and decision-making</li><li>The authors propose that interventions based on the sidelining-bias approach aim to <strong>elevate a nonbiased or antibiased alternative self</strong> and ideal goals for which biased behavior would not be functional. By activating a working self that prioritizes these alternative goals, individuals may be less likely to engage in biased behavior</li></ul></li><li>How is the sidelining approach different from common bias-reduction approaches?<ul><li>One key difference is that the sidelining approach <strong>treats bias (or non-bias, or anti-bias) as an <em>expression</em> of the working self</strong> and the kinds of goals that this self can pursue in a given context. This shifts responsibility and causality from bad individuals to bad situations</li><li>Additionally, interventions based on the sidelining approach are designed to <strong>mitigate discrimination by elevating a nonbiased (or antibiased) alternative self</strong> and ideal goals for which biased behavior would not be functional</li><li>Overall, the sidelining approach is designed to change the way people see themselves in a given context, rather than simply changing their attitudes or beliefs about others</li></ul></li><li>What interventions are consistent with the sidelining approach? Why would each of these work to sideline bias?<ul><li>he article provides examples of interventions consistent with the sidelining approach, such as &ldquo;asking individuals to reflect on a time when they were successful in not behaving in a biased manner and to consider how they can apply these insights to their current context&rdquo; [2]. Another example is &ldquo;asking individuals to reflect on an alternative self that is not biased and to consider how they can activate this self in their current context&rdquo;</li><li>The authors suggest that these interventions work to sideline bias by shifting individuals&rsquo; focus away from their biases and towards alternative selves and goals that are not biased. By doing so, these interventions can help individuals disengage from biased behaviors and instead engage in behaviors that align with their nonbiased or antibiased alternative selves and goals. This, in turn, can lead to more equitable outcomes in real-world contexts [1].</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li>No backlinks found</li></ul></div><div><script async src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://mel10c.github.io/mel.zhu/js/graph.2d9e48dbe7ea47c0ef1c58296ce14448.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by Melaney Zhu using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, © 2023</p><ul><li><a href=https://mel10c.github.io/mel.zhu/>Home</a></li><li><a href=https://www.instagram.com/melaney_dxl/>Instagram</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/mel10c>GitHub</a></li><li><a href=https://linkedin.com/in/melzyy>LinkedIn</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/mel10c/mel.zhu/blob/hugo/content/documents/Resume.pdf>Resume</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>

What are attribution theories? How is each relevant to understanding disability stigma?<ul><li>Essentialism<ul><li><em>Essentialism</em> is the belief that there is an <strong>inherent and immutable nature to certain categories</strong>, including disabilities.</li><li>It suggests that individuals with disabilities are fundamentally different from those without disabilities and that these <strong>differences are fixed and unchangeable</strong>.</li><li>Essentialism can <strong>lead to stigmatization and discrimination</strong> towards people with disabilities.</li></ul></li><li>Attributions<ul><li><em>Attribution theories</em>, on the other hand, refer to <strong>the ways in which people make judgments about the causes of events or behaviors</strong>.<ul><li>These theories seek to explain why people behave in certain ways and attribute these behaviors to different causes, such as internal factors like personality traits or external factors like situational circumstances.</li></ul></li><li>Attribution theories are relevant to understanding disability stigma because they can shape the ways in which people view and treat individuals with disabilities.</li></ul></li><li>Relevance<ul><li>For example, people may <strong>attribute a congenital disability to internal factors</strong>, such as <em>genetics</em>, and therefore view the individual as being fundamentally different from others.</li><li>In contrast, they may <strong>attribute an acquired disability to external factors</strong>, such as a <em>traumatic accident</em>, and view the <strong>individual as being responsible for their disability</strong>, leading to blame and stigma. These attributional processes can have a significant impact on the experiences of individuals with disabilities and can shape the ways in which they are treated by society.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>How did the authors test their hypotheses and research questions? How did the three studies differ from one another?<ul><li>Study 1<ul><li>Study 1 involved an <em>online survey</em> that was completed by 360 participants, who were asked to <strong>rate their level of agreement with statements</strong> that were designed to measure beliefs about people with congenital versus acquired disabilities.</li><li>The results showed that participants were more likely to view individuals with <strong>congenital disabilities as helpless and dependent,</strong> while those with <strong>acquired disabilities were viewed as more responsible for their condition</strong>.</li></ul></li><li>Study 2<ul><li>Study 2 involved a <em>laboratory experiment</em> in which 73 participants were <strong>asked to rate their level of agreement with statements</strong> that attributed responsibility for a hypothetical disability to either genetic or lifestyle factors.</li><li>The results showed that participants were <strong>more likely to attribute responsibility for a disability to lifestyle factors when it was described as acquired</strong>, compared to when it was described as congenital.</li></ul></li><li>Study 3<ul><li>Study 3 involved a <em>second laboratory experiment</em> with 148 participants, who were asked to <strong>read a hypothetical scenario about a person</strong> with either a congenital or acquired disability and <strong>rate their level of agreement with statements</strong> that were designed to measure stigma.</li><li>The results showed that participants <strong>stigmatized individuals with congenital disabilities more than those with acquired disabilities</strong>.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>What variables were manipulated in Study 3, and how did the authors manipulate them?<ul><li>Manipulation target<ul><li>The authors manipulated two variables: <strong>the type of disability</strong> (congenital vs. acquired) and the age of onset of the disability (early childhood vs. adulthood).</li></ul></li><li>Method<ul><li>Created <strong>two different hypothetical scenarios</strong> in which the disability was either congenital or acquired. In the congenital condition, the individual had a disability from birth, while in the acquired condition, the individual developed the disability later in life.</li><li>To manipulate the <strong>age of onset of the disability</strong>, the authors included information about the age at which the disability began in each of the scenarios. In the early childhood condition, the disability began before the age of five, while in the adulthood condition, the disability began after the age of 18.</li></ul></li><li>Experiment<ul><li>Participants in Study 3 were <strong>randomly assigned to one of the four conditions</strong>: <em>congenital/early childhood, congenital/adulthood, acquired/early childhood, or acquired/adulthood</em>. After reading the scenario, participants were asked to rate their level of agreement with statements that were designed to measure stigma towards the individual with the disability.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>What did the studies find? What conclusions do the authors draw about their findings?<ul><li>Individual studies</li><li>First, they argue that <strong>the belief that individuals with <em>congenital disabilities</em> are helpless and dependent is a form of <em>essentialism</em> that reinforces the stereotype of disability as a tragedy</strong>.</li><li>Second, they suggest that the tendency to <strong><em>attribute</em> responsibility for acquired disabilities to lifestyle factors is a form of <em>victim-blaming</em> that reinforces the stereotype of disability as a personal failure.</strong></li><li>Finally, they argue that the stigmatization of individuals with congenital disabilities can have <strong>negative consequences for their self-esteem, social relationships, and access to resources and support</strong>. The authors call for a more inclusive and accepting society that recognizes the abilities and contributions of people with disabilities, regardless of the nature of their disability.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>[@2016CRAIG-StigmaBasedSolidarityUnderstanding]<ul><li><img src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mel10c/image/main/obsidian/20230313110417.png width=400/></li><li>According to the authors, under what conditions would people be more likely to show coalitional, rather than derogatory, attitudes toward other stigmatized people?<ol><li>Perceived <em>commonality</em>:<ul><li>When individuals perceive that they <strong>share similar stigmatized identities with members of other stigmatized groups</strong>, they are more likely to <strong>show <em>coalitional</em> attitudes toward them</strong>.</li><li>The <strong>greater the perceived similarity</strong> or overlap between stigmatized groups, the more likely individuals are to <strong>view members of other groups as <em>potential allies</em></strong> rather than competitors.</li></ul></li><li>Perceived <em>threat</em>:<ul><li>When individuals perceive a <strong>common threat from an external source</strong>, such as discrimination or prejudice from the dominant group, they are more likely to <strong>show coalitional attitudes toward other stigmatized groups</strong>.</li><li>In such situations, individuals may perceive that they share a common enemy and may be more willing to <strong>work together to <em>fight against this common threat</em></strong>.</li></ul></li><li>Perceived <em>legitimacy</em>:<ul><li>When individuals perceive that members of other stigmatized groups <strong>face similar levels of prejudice and discrimination as they do</strong>, they are more likely to show coalitional attitudes toward them.</li><li>In other words, if individuals view members of other stigmatized groups as legitimately stigmatized, they may be more <strong>likely to <em>empathize</em> with them and view them as allies.</strong></li></ul></li></ol><ul><li>In contrast, individuals are more likely to <strong>show derogatory attitudes</strong> toward members of other stigmatized groups <strong>when they perceive these groups as <em>different</em> from their own</strong>, when they perceive them as less legitimate, or when they <strong>view them as competitors for limited resources</strong>.</li></ul></li><li>What are three ways to facilitate more coalitional attitudes among people of different stigmatized groups?<ol><li>Explicitly connecting the in-group to another stigmatized group<ul><li>Encouraging members of different stigmatized groups to <strong>interact with each other</strong> can help promote coalitional attitudes by breaking down barriers and promoting a sense of shared identity</li><li>Common experiences or challenges are also associated with more coalitional attitudes among stigmatized groups</li><li>Emphasizing the <strong>shared experiences and commonalities</strong> between stigmatized groups can help promote coalitional attitudes by highlighting the similarities rather than the differences between groups.</li></ul></li><li>Meaning making<ul><li>Encouraging members of stigmatized groups to work together to <strong>achieve shared goals</strong> can help promote coalitional attitudes by fostering a sense of collective efficacy.</li></ul></li><li>Personal connection to stigmatization

Specifically, the study found that <em>societal acceptance</em> of sexual minorities and <strong>legal recognition</strong> of same-sex relationships were <strong>positively associated with intimacy, relationship satisfaction, and commitment</strong> among same-sex couples. Public support for same-sex marriage was positively associated with intimacy and commitment, but not with relationship satisfaction</li><li>However, the study also found that <strong>minority stress variables</strong>, such as experiences of discrimination and internalized homophobia, were <strong>negatively associated with relationship</strong> quality among same-sex couples, and partially mediated the relationship between social change variables and relationship quality</li><li>The evidence for the hypotheses was <strong>moderately strong,</strong> as the study used a large sample size and statistical analyses to examine the relationships between variables. However, the study was cross-sectional, which means that it cannot establish causal relationships between variables. Additionally, the study relied on <em>self-report measures, which may be subject to biases and limitations</em>. Future research that uses longitudinal or experimental designs may provide stronger evidence for the social change hypothesis and its relationship with same-sex relationship quality.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><a href=#lectures><h2 id=lectures><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Lectures</h2></a><ul><li><a class="internal-link broken">322 - L7</a></li><li><a class="internal-link broken">322 - L8</a></li></ul></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li>No backlinks found</li></ul></div><div><script async src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://mel10c.github.io/mel.zhu/js/graph.2d9e48dbe7ea47c0ef1c58296ce14448.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by Melaney Zhu using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, © 2023</p><ul><li><a href=https://mel10c.github.io/mel.zhu/>Home</a></li><li><a href=https://www.instagram.com/melaney_dxl/>Instagram</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/mel10c>GitHub</a></li><li><a href=https://linkedin.com/in/melzyy>LinkedIn</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/mel10c/mel.zhu/blob/hugo/content/documents/Resume.pdf>Resume</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>

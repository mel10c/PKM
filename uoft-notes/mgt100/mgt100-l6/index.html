Trade provides a <strong>new market</strong> for products and <strong>access to needed resources</strong>. Trading makes production and distribution systems more efficient and reduces dependence on the economy of the domestic market.</li><li>Countries that encourage international trade usually have higher levels of economic activity, employment, and wages than countries that restrict international trade.</li><li>Nations usually benefit if they <strong>specialize</strong> in producing certain goods or services</li></ul></li><li>What are some measures of the size of the international marketplace?<ul><li><em>Developing countries</em> have <strong>lower per capita incomes</strong> than the developed nations in North America and Western Europe, but developing nations have <strong>populations that are large and growing</strong>. China’s population is about 1.4 billion and India’s is roughly 1.3 billion.</li></ul></li><li>★ How does a nation acquire a absolute/comparative advantage?<ul><li>A country has an <em>absolute advantage</em> if it holds a <strong>monopoly</strong> or if it produces a good or service at a <strong>lower cost</strong> than other nations.</li><li>It has a <em>comparative advantage</em> if it can supply one product more <strong>efficiently</strong> or at a lower cost than it can produce other products.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Measuring trade between nations<ul><li>Compare balance of trade and balance of payments.<ul><li><em>Balance of trade</em> is the <strong>difference between exports and imports</strong>;</li><li><em>Balance of payments</em> is the overall <strong>flow of money</strong> into or out of a country. It includes overseas loans and borrowing, international investments, and profits from such investments.</li></ul></li><li>Explain the function of an exchange rate.<ul><li>A nation’s exchange rate is the rate at which <strong>its currency can be exchanged</strong> for the currencies of other nations. An exchange rate makes it easier for countries with different currencies to trade with each another.</li></ul></li><li>What happens when a currency is devalued?<ul><li>Devaluation is a reduction in a currency’s value in terms of other currencies or in terms of a fixed standard.</li><li>When the value of the Canadian dollar falls compared with other currencies, the cost paid by foreign businesses and households for Canadian products declines, and demand for exports may rise.</li><li>An increase in the value of the dollar raises the prices of Canadian products sold abroad, but it reduces the prices of foreign products sold in Canada.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Major barriers of international trade<ul><li>How can values and attitudes form a barrier to trade, and how can these barriers be overcome<ul><li>Marked differences in values and attitudes, such as religious attitudes, can form barriers between traditionally capitalist countries and countries adopting new capitalist systems.</li><li>Many of these barriers can be overcome by <strong>learning about the values and attitudes in other cultures</strong> and by respecting such differences.</li></ul></li><li>What is a tariff? What is its purpose?<ul><li>A <em>tariff</em> (关税) is a <strong>surcharge or duty charged on foreign products</strong>. Its purpose is to protect domestic producers of those items.</li></ul></li><li>Why is dumping a problem for companies marketing goods internationally?<ul><li><em>Dumping</em> is selling products in other countries at <strong>prices below production costs or below typical prices in the home market</strong>.</li><li>Dumping decreases the cost of products in the market where they are dumped. Thus, dumping <strong>hurts the domestic producers</strong> of those products.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Economic communities<ul><li>Canadian economic agreements<ul><li>Three economic agreements are the Canada–United States–Mexico Agreement (which replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement), CAFTA-DR, and the European Union.</li></ul></li><li>What international trade organization succeeded GATT, and what is its goal?<ul><li>The <em>World Trade Organization (WTO)</em> succeeded GATT. Its goals are to <strong>monitor GATT agreements</strong>, mediate disputes, and continue GATT’s aim to reduce trade barriers throughout the world.</li></ul></li><li>Compare and contrast the goals of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.<ul><li>The World Bank funds projects that build or <strong>expand nations’ infrastructure</strong>. These projects include transportation, education, and medical systems and facilities.</li><li>The International Monetary Fund makes <strong>short-term loans</strong> to member nations that cannot meet their expenses. The fund operates as a lender of last resort for troubled nations.</li></ul></li><li>What are the goals of the European Union, and how do these goals promote international trade?<ul><li>The <em>European Union’s</em> goals are to promote economic and social progress, to introduce European citizenship as a complement to national citizenship, and to give the EU a major role in international affairs. <strong>Bringing standards and laws together</strong> can contribute to international trade and economic growth.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Level of involvement<ul><li>Name three possible strategies for beginning overseas operations. ^b2b7e3<ol><li><strong>Exporting</strong> or <strong>importing</strong></li><li>Using contract-based agreements such as <strong>franchising, licensing, or subcontracting</strong></li><li>Making direct <strong>investments</strong> in foreign markets through acquisition, joint venture, or setting up an overseas division.</li></ol></li><li>What is countertrade?<ul><li><em>Countertrade</em> is an agreement to make payments in the form of <strong>local products</strong>, not in currency.</li></ul></li><li>Compare and contrast licensing and subcontracting.<ul><li>In a foreign <em>licensing</em> agreement, one firm <strong>allows another firm to produce or sell its product</strong> or use its trademark, patent, or manufacturing process in a specific geographical area. In return, the firm receives <strong>royalty payments</strong> or other compensation.</li><li>In international <em>subcontracting</em>, a firm <strong>hires local companies in other countries to produce</strong>, distribute, or sell its goods and services.</li></ul></li><li>Describe joint ventures.<ul><li>In a <em>joint venture</em>, a company shares risks, costs, profits, and management responsibilities with one or more host-country companies.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Global vs. Multi-domestic ^17ca26<ul><li>What is a global business strategy? What are its advantages?<ul><li>A <em>global business strategy</em> is a <strong>standardized competitive strategy</strong>. The firm sells the <strong>same product</strong> in basically the same way all over the world. This strategy works well for goods and services that are common to many nations. The firm can market the products to many countries without making many changes.</li><li>Ex. Aplple</li></ul></li><li>What is a multidomestic business strategy? What are its advantages?<ul><li>In a <em>multidomestic business strategy</em>, the firm <strong>treats each foreign market in a different way</strong>. The firm tries to appeal to the customs, tastes, and buying habits of specific national markets. This strategy allows the firm to change its marketing appeals to suit individual cultures or areas.</li><li>Ex.

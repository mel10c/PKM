Any interview questions should be concerned only with the job applicant’s abilities. The firm should be free to ask these questions.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Strategies for developing employees<ul><li>What are some common employee trainings and why?<ul><li>New employees often complete an orientation, also called <em>onboarding</em>, program where they learn about company policies and practices.</li><li>Training programs provide opportunities for employees to <strong>build their skills and knowledge</strong>. These new skills can also prepare them for new job opportunities within the company.</li><li>Training also helps employers to keep long-term, loyal, high-performing employees.</li><li>Performance appraisals give employees feedback about their strengths and weaknesses and how they can improve.</li></ul></li><li>What are the benefits of computer-based training?<ul><li>Computer-based training offers <strong>consistent presentations and interactive learning</strong>. Employees can also learn at their own pace. Computer-based training is also <strong>less expensive</strong> than other types of training.</li></ul></li><li>What is a management development program?<ul><li><em>Management development program</em> provides training designed to improve the skills and broaden the knowledge of current and potential executives.</li></ul></li><li>What are the four criteria, or standards, of an effective performance appraisal?<ol><li>A performance appraisal should take place several times a year</li><li>Be linked to organizational goals</li><li>Be based on objective measures</li><li>Be a two-way conversation.</li></ol></li></ul></li><li>Compensations<ul><li>What are some common compensations?<ul><li>Firms compensate employees with wages, salaries, incentive pay systems, and benefits. Benefit programs vary among firms, but most companies offer health care programs, insurance, retirement plans, and sick leave. More and more companies offer flexible benefit plans and flexible work plans, such as flextime, compressed workweeks, job sharing, and home-based work.</li></ul></li><li>Explain the difference between wage and salary.<ul><li><em>Wages</em> are based on an hourly pay rate or the amount of work accomplished.</li><li><em>Salaries</em> are paid periodically, such as weekly or monthly. Salaries do not rise or fall with the number of hours worked.</li></ul></li><li>What are flexible benefit plans? How do they work?<ul><li>Flexible benefit plans offer a <strong>choice</strong> of benefits, including different types of medical insurance, dental and vision benefits, and life and disability insurance. Typically, each employee receives a set allowance (also known as flex dollars) to pay for these benefits that suit his or her needs.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Employee separation, downsizing, outsourcing<ul><li>What is the difference between voluntary and involuntary turnover?<ul><li><em>Voluntary turnover</em> occurs when employees leave firms for their own reasons, such as to start their own businesses, take jobs with other firms, move to another community, or retire.</li><li><em>Involuntary turnover</em> occurs because of employees’ poor job performance or unethical behaviour in their business practices or in the workplace. It can also occur when a company is forced to eliminate jobs.</li></ul></li><li>What is downsizing? How is it different from outsourcing?<ul><li><em>Downsizing</em> is the process of reducing the number of employees within a firm by eliminating jobs. Downsizing is done to cut overhead costs and streamline the organizational structure.</li><li><em>Outsourcing</em> occurs when companies contract with other firms to perform noncore jobs or business functions, such as housekeeping, maintenance, or relocation services. Outsourcing allows companies to focus on what they do best. It can also result in a downsized workforce.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Methods and theories of motivation<ul><li>Theories about motivation<ul><li>Employee motivation starts with high employee morale.
According to ,<a class="internal-link broken">Maslow&rsquo;s Hierarchy of Needs</a> people satisfy lower-order needs (such as food and safety) before moving to higher-order needs (such as esteem and fulfillment).</li><li>Herzberg’s two-factor model of motivation is based on the fulfillment of hygiene factors and motivation factors.</li><li>Expectancy theory suggests that people use these factors to decide whether to make the effort needed to complete a task.</li><li>Equity theory refers to a person’s view of fair and equitable treatment.</li><li>Goal-setting theory says that people will be motivated to the extent to which they accept specific, challenging goals.</li><li>Job design is also used by managers for motivation.</li></ul></li><li>What are the four steps in the process of motivation?<ul><li><code>Need --> motivation --> goal-directed behaviour --> need satisfaction</code></li></ul></li><li>Explain how goal-setting works.<ul><li>People will be motivated to the extent to which they accept specific, challenging goals and receive feedback that shows their progress toward goal achievement.</li></ul></li><li>Describe the three ways that managers design jobs for increased motivation.<ol><li><em>Job enlargement</em> is a job design that expands an employee’s responsibilities by increasing the number and variety of tasks.</li><li><em>Job enrichment</em> changes the job duties to increase employees’ authority in planning their work, deciding how it should be done, and learning new skills that help them grow.</li><li><em>Job rotation</em> involves a system of moving employees from one job to another.</li></ol></li></ul></li><li>Labour-management relations<ul><li>What is a labour union? What is collective bargaining?
A labour union is a group of workers who organize themselves to work toward common goals in the areas of wages, hours, and working conditions. Collective bargaining is the process of negotiation between management and union representatives.</li><li>What are the three main tactics used by unions to win support for their demands?<ul><li>Unions’ main tactics are strikes (walkouts), picketing, and boycotts.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><a href=#lecture><h1 id=lecture><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Lecture</h1></a><ul><li><code>PDF</code>:</li></ul><blockquote><p><a class="internal-link broken">Strategic Human Resource Management</a></p></blockquote><ul><li><a href=#google-work-environment><h2 id=google-work-environment><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Google Work Environment</h2></a><pre><code> ```ad-example
